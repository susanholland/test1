<div class='line'><p>The year 1797, the year of this narrative, belongs to a period<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>which as every thinker  now feels, involved a crisis for Christen-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>dom not exceeded in its undetermined momentousness at the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>time by any other era whereof there is record.  The opening<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>proposition made by the Spirit of that Age, involved the rectification of the Old World&#x0027;s hereditary wrongs.  In France  to some<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>extent this was bloodily  effected. But what then? Straightway the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Revolution  itself became a wrongdoer, one  more oppressive than<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the kings. Under Napoleon it enthroned upstart kings, and initi-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ated that prolonged agony of continual war whose final throe was<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Waterloo. During those years not the wisest could  have foreseen<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>that the outcome of all would be what to some thinkers  ap-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>parently it has since  turned out to be, a political advance along<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>nearly the whole line for Europeans. </p></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n6" n="132"/></div>
<div class='line'><p>Now, as elsewhere hinted, it was something caught from the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Revolutionary Spirit that at Spithead emboldened the man-of-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>war&#x0027;s men to rise against real abuses, long-standing ones,  and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>afterwards at the Nore to make inordinate and  aggressive de-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>mands, successful resistance to which was confirmed only when<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the ringleaders were hung for an admonitory spectacle to the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>anchored  fleet. Yet in a way analogous to the operation of the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Revolution at large the Great  Mutiny, though by Englishmen <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>naturally deemed monstrous at the time, doubtless gave the first<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>latent prompting to most important reforms in the British Navy. </p></div>

<div class='line'><head>Billy Budd Sailor<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>(An inside narrative.) <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>1</head></div>
<div class='line'><p>In the time before steamships, or then  more frequently than now,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a stroller along the docks of any considerable seaport would<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>occasionally have his attention arrested by a group of bronzed<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>mariners, man-of-war&#x0027;s men or merchant-sailors in holiday attire<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ashore on liberty. In certain instances  they would flank, or, like<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a body-guard quite surround some superior figure of their own<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>class,  moving along with them like Aldebaran  among the lesser<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>lights of his constellation. That signal object  was the &#x201C;Handsome<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Sailor&#x201D; of the less prosaic time alike  of the military and merchant<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>navies. With no perceptible trace of the vainglorious about him, <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>rather with the off-hand unaffectedness of natural  regality, he<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n8" n="134"/></div>
<div class='line'>seemed to accept the spontaneous homage of his shipmates. A<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>somewhat remarkable instance recurs to me.  In Liverpool, now<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>half a century ago I saw under the shadow of the great dingy<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>street-wall of Prince&#x0027;s Dock (an obstruction long since removed)<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a common sailor, so intensely black that he must needs have been<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a native African of the unadulterate blood of Ham.  A sym-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>metric  figure much above the average height. The two ends of a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>gay silk handkerchief thrown loose about the neck danced upon<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the displayed ebony of his chest; in his ears were big hoops of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>gold, and a Scotch Highland  bonnet with a tartan band  set<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>off his shapely head.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>It was a  hot noon in July; and his  face, lustrous with per-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>spiration, beamed with barbaric  good humor. In jovial sallies<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>right and left his white teeth flashing into view,  he rollicked<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>along, the center of a company of his shipmates. These were made<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>up of such an assortment of tribes and complexions as would<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>have well fitted them to be marched up by  Anacharsis Cloots<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>before the bar of the first French Assembly as Representatives of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the Human Race. At each spontaneous tribute rendered by the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>wayfarers to  this black pagod of a  fellow&#x2014;the tribute of a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>pause and stare, and less frequent an exclamation,&#x2014;the motley<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>retinue showed that they took that sort of pride in the evoker of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n9" n="135"/></div>
<div class='line'>it  which the Assyrian priests doubtless showed for their grand<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sculptured  Bull when the faithful prostrated themselves.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>To return. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>If in some cases a bit of a nautical Murat in setting forth his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>person ashore, the handsome sailor  of the period in question<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>evinced nothing of the dandified  Billy-be-Damn, an amusing<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>character all but extinct now, but occasionally to be encountered,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and in a form yet more amusing than the original,  at the tiller of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the boats on the tempestuous Erie Canal or, more likely, vaporing<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>in the groggeries along the tow-path. Invariably a proficient in his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>perilous calling, he was also more or less of a mighty boxer or<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>wrestler. It was strength and beauty. Tales of his prowess were<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>recited.  Ashore he was the champion; afloat the spokesman; on<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>every suitable occasion  always foremost. Close-reefing topsails<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>in a gale, there he was, astride the weather yard-arm-end, foot in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the Flemish horse as  &#x201C;stirrup,&#x201D; both hands tugging at the &#x201C;ear-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ring&#x201D; as at a bridle, in very much  the attitude of young Alexan-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>der curbing the fiery Bucephalus. A superb figure, tossed up as by<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the horns of Taurus against the thunderous sky, cheerily hallooing<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to the strenuous file along the spar.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>The moral nature was seldom out of keeping with the physical<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>make. Indeed, except as toned by the former, the comeliness and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>power, always attractive in masculine conjunction, hardly could<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>have drawn the sort of honest homage  the Handsome Sailor in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>some examples received from his less gifted associates.</p></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n10" n="136"/></div>
<div class='line'><p>Such a cynosure, at least in aspect, and something such too in <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>nature, though with important variations made apparent  as the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>story proceeds, was welkin-eyed Billy Budd, or Baby Budd as<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>more familiarly under circumstances hereafter to be given he at<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>last came to be called  aged twenty-one,  a foretopman  of the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>British fleet toward the close of the last decade of the eighteenth<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>century. It was  not very long prior to the time of the narration<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>that follows that he had entered the King&#x0027;s Service,  having been<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>impressed on the Narrow Seas from a homeward-bound English<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>merchantman into a seventy-four outward-bound, <hi rend="italic">H.M.S. Indomi-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>table</hi>; which  ship, as was not unusual in those hurried days had<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>been obliged to put to sea short of her proper complement of men.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Plump upon Billy at first sight in the gangway  the boarding<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>officer Lieutenant Ratcliffe  pounced, even before the merchant-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>man&#x0027;s crew formally  was mustered on the quarter-deck for his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>deliberate  inspection. And him only he elected. For whether it<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was because the other men when ranged before him showed to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ill advantage after Billy, or whether he had some scruples in view<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of the merchantman being rather short-handed, however it might<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>be, the officer contented himself with his first spontaneous choice.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>To the surprise of the ship&#x0027;s company, though much to the Lieu-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tenant&#x0027;s satisfaction Billy made no demur.  But, indeed, any<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n11" n="137"/></div>
<div class='line'>demur would have been as idle as the protest of a goldfinch<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>popped into a  cage.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Noting his uncomplaining acquiescence, all but cheerful one<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>might say, the shipmates turned  a surprised glance of silent<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>reproach at the sailor. The shipmaster  was one of those worthy<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>mortals found in every vocation even the humbler ones &#x2014;the sort<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of person whom everybody agrees in calling &#x201C;a respectable man.&#x201D;<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>And&#x2014;nor so strange to report as it may appear to be&#x2014;though a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ploughman of the troubled waters, life-long contending with the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>intractable elements, there was nothing this honest soul at heart<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>loved better than simple peace and quiet.  For the rest, he was<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>fifty or thereabouts, a little inclined to corpulence, a prepossessing<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>face, unwhiskered, and of an agreeable color&#x2014;a rather full face, <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>humanely intelligent in expression. On a fair day with a fair wind<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and all going well, a certain musical chime in his voice seemed to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>be the veritable unobstructed outcome of the innermost man. He<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>had much prudence, much conscientiousness, and there were<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>occasions when these virtues were the cause of overmuch disquie-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tude in him.  On a passage, so long as his craft was in any proxim-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ity to land, no sleep for Captain Graveling. He took to heart those<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>serious responsibilities not so heavily borne by some shipmasters.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Now while Billy Budd was down in the forecastle getting his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>kit together, the <hi rend="italic">Indomitable&#x0027;s</hi> lieutenant, burly and bluff, nowise<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>disconcerted by Captain Graveling&#x0027;s omitting to proffer the cus-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tomary hospitalities on an occasion so unwelcome to him, an<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n12" n="138"/></div>
<div class='line'>omission simply caused by preoccupation of thought, unceremoni-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ously invited himself into the cabin, and also to a flask from the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>spirit-locker, a receptacle which his experienced eye instantly<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>discovered. In fact he was one of those sea-dogs in whom all the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>hardship and peril of naval life in the great prolonged wars of his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>time never impaired  the natural instinct for sensuous enjoyment.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>His duty he always faithfully did; but duty is sometimes a dry<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>obligation, and he was for irrigating its aridity  whensoever<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>possible with a fertilizing decoction of strong waters. For the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cabin&#x0027;s proprietor there was nothing left but to play the part of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the enforced host with whatever grace and alacrity were practi-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cable. As necessary adjuncts to the flask, he silently placed tumbler<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and water-jug before the irrepressible guest. But excusing himself<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>from partaking just then, &#x003C;he&#x003E; dismally watched the unembar-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>rassed officer deliberately diluting his grog a little, then tossing<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>it off in three swallows, pushing the empty tumbler away, yet not<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>so far as to be beyond easy reach, at the same &#x003C;time&#x003E; settling<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>himself in his seat and smacking his lips with high satisfaction,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>looking straight at the host.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>These proceedings over, the Master broke the silence;  and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>there lurked a rueful reproach in the tone of his voice; &#x201C;Lieu-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tenant, you are going to take my best man from me, the jewel of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>&#x0027;em.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Yes, I know&#x201D; rejoined the other, immediately drawing back<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the tumbler preliminary to a replenishing;  &#x201C;Yes I know. Sorry.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Beg pardon, but you don&#x0027;t understand, Lieutenant. See here<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>now. Before I shipped that young fellow, my forecastle was a <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>rat-pit of quarrels. It was black times, I tell you,  aboard the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n13" n="139"/></div>
<div class='line'>&#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Rights</hi>&#x2019; here. I was worried to that degree my pipe had no com-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>fort for me. But Billy came; and it was like a Catholic priest<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>striking peace in an Irish shindy. Not that he preached to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>them or said or did anything in particular; but a virtue went out<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of him, sugaring the sour ones. They took to him like hornets to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>treacle; all but the bluffer of the gang, the big shaggy chap with<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the fire-red whiskers. He indeed out of envy, perhaps, of the new-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>comer, and thinking such a &#x2018;sweet and pleasant fellow&#x2019;, as he<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>mockingly designated him to the others,  could hardly have the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>spirit of a game-cock, must needs bestir himself in trying to get up<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>an ugly row with him. Billy forebore with him and reasoned with<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>him in a pleasant  way&#x2014;he is something like myself, lieutenant,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to whom aught like a quarrel is hateful&#x2014;but nothing served. So,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>in the second dog-watch one day the Red Whiskers in presence<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of the others, under pretence of showing Billy just  whence a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sirloin steak was cut&#x2014;for the fellow had once been a butcher&#x2014;<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>insultingly gave him a dig under the ribs. Quick as lightning<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Billy let fly his arm.  I dare say he never meant to do quite as<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>much as he did, but anyhow he gave the burly fool a terrible<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>drubbing. It took about half a minute, I should think.  And, Lord<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>bless you, the lubber was astonished at the celerity. And will you<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>believe it, Lieutenant, the Red Whiskers now really loves Billy&#x2014;<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>loves him, or is the biggest hypocrite that ever I heard of. But they<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>all love him. Some of &#x0027;em do his washing, darn  his old trousers<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>for him; the carpenter is at odd times making a pretty little chest<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of drawers for him. Anybody will do anything for Billy Budd; <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and it&#x0027;s the happy family here. But now Lieutenant,  if that young<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n14" n="140"/></div>
<div class='line'>fellow goes&#x2014;I know how it will be aboard the &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Rights</hi>.&#x2019;  Not again<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>very soon  shall I, coming up from dinner, lean over the capstan<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>smoking a quiet pipe&#x2014;no, not very soon again, I think. Ay, Lieu-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tenant, you are going to take away the jewel of &#x0027;em; you are going<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to take away my peacemaker!&#x201D; And with that the good soul had<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>really some ado in checking a  rising sob. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Well,&#x201D; said the officer  who had listened with amused<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>interest to all this, and now waxing merry with his tipple; &#x201C;Well, blessed<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>are the peacemakers especially the fighting peacemakers!  And<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>such are the seventy-four beauties some of which you see poking<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>their noses out of the port-holes of yonder warship lying-to for me&#x201D;<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>pointing through the cabin window of the <hi rend="italic">Indomitable</hi>.  &#x201C;But<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>courage! don&#x0027;t look so downhearted, man. Why, I pledge you in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>advance the royal  approbation. Rest assured that His Majesty<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>will be delighted to know that in a time when his hardtack is not<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sought for by sailors with such avidity as should be; a time also<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>when some shipmasters privily resent the borrowing from them<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a tar or two for the service;  His Majesty, I say, will be delighted<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to learn that <hi rend="italic">one</hi> shipmaster at least  cheerfully surrenders to the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>King,  the flower of his flock, a sailor who with equal loyalty<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>makes no dissent. &#x2014;But where&#x0027;s my beauty? Ah,&#x201D; looking through<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the cabin&#x0027;s open door &#x201C;Here he comes; and, by Jove&#x2014;lugging<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n15" n="141"/></div>
<div class='line'>along his chest &#x2014;Apollo with his portmanteau!&#x2014;My man,&#x201D;<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>stepping out to him, &#x201C;you can&#x0027;t take that big box  on board a war-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ship. The boxes  there are mostly shot-boxes. Put your duds in a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>bag, lad.  Boot and saddle for the cavalryman, bag and ham-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>mock for the man-of-war&#x0027;s man.&#x201D; </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>The transfer from chest to bag  was made. And, after seeing<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>his man into the cutter and then following him down, the lieu-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tenant  pushed off from the <hi rend="italic">Rights-of-Man</hi>. That was the mer-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>chant ship&#x0027;s name; though by her master and crew abbreviated in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sailor fashion into <hi rend="italic">The Rights</hi>.  The hard-headed Dundee owner<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was  a staunch admirer of Thomas Paine whose book  in rejoin-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>der to Burke&#x0027;s arraignment of the French Revolution had then<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>been published for some time and had gone everywhere. In chris-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tening his vessel after the title of Paine&#x0027;s volume  the man of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Dundee was something like his contemporary shipowner, Stephen<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Girard of Philadelphia, whose sympathies, alike with his native<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>land and its liberal philosophers, he evinced by naming his ships<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>after Voltaire, Diderot, and so forth. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>But now, when the boat swept under the merchant &#x003C;man&#x0027;s&#x003E; <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>stern, and officer and oarsmen were noting &#x2014;some bitterly and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>others with a grin,&#x2014;  the name emblazoned there; just then it<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n16" n="142"/></div>
<div class='line'>was that the new recruit  jumped up from the bow where the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>coxswain had directed him to sit, and waving his  hat to his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>silent shipmates sorrowfully looking over at him from the taffrail,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>bade the lads a genial  good-bye.  Then making a salutation as<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to the ship herself, &#x201C;And good-bye to you too, old,  <hi rend="italic">Rights of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Man!</hi>&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Down, Sir!&#x201D; roared the  lieutenant, instantly assuming all the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>rigor of his rank, though with difficulty repressing a smile.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>To be sure, Billy&#x0027;s action was a terrible breach of naval decorum.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>But in that decorum  he had never been instructed; in considera-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tion of which the lieutenant would hardly have been so energetic<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>in reproof but  for the concluding farewell to the ship. This he<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>rather took as meant to convey a covert sally on the new recruit&#x0027;s<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>part, a sly slur at  impressment in general, and that of himself in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>especial. And yet, more likely, if satire it was in effect, it was<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>hardly so by intention, for Billy, though happily endowed with the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>gaiety of high health, youth and a free heart, was yet by no means<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of a satirical turn. The will to it and the sinister  dexterity were<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>alike wanting.  To deal in double meaning and insinuations of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>any sort was quite  foreign to his nature.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>As to his enforced enlistment,  that he seemed to take pretty<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n17" n="143"/></div>
<div class='line'>much as he was wont to take  any vicissitude of weather. Like<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the animals, though no philosopher, he was, without knowing it,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>practically  a fatalist. And, it may be, that he rather liked this<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>adventurous turn in his affairs, which promised an opening into<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>novel scenes and martial excitements.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Aboard the <hi rend="italic">Indomitable</hi> our merchant-sailor  was forthwith<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>rated as an able-seaman and assigned to the starboard watch of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the foretop. He was soon at home in the service, not at all disliked<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>for his unpretentious  good looks and a sort of genial happy-go-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>lucky air. No merrier man in his mess: in marked contrast to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>certain other individuals included like himself among the im-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>pressed portions of the ship&#x0027;s company; for these when not ac-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tively employed were sometimes, and more particularly in the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>last  dog-watch when the drawing near of twilight  induced<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>revery, apt to fall into a saddish mood which in some partook of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sullenness. But they were not so young as our foretopman, and no<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>few of them must have known a hearth of some sort,  others may<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>have had wives and children left, too probably, in uncertain cir-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cumstances, and hardly any but must have acknowledged kith<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and kin, while for Billy, as will shortly be seen, his entire family<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was practically invested in  himself.</p></div>
<div class='line'></div1></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n18" n="144"/></div>
<div class='line'><div1 xml:id="t1-body-d3" type="chapter"></div>
<div class='line'><head>2</head></div>
<div class='line'><p>Though our new-made foretopman was well received in the top<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and on the gun-decks, hardly here was he that cynosure he had<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>previously been among those minor ship&#x0027;s companies of the mer-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>chant marine, with which companies only had he hitherto con-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sorted.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>He was young; and despite his all but fully developed frame in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>aspect looked even younger than he really was, owing to a linger-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ing adolescent expression in the as yet smooth face all but femi-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>nine in purity in natural complexion but where, thanks to his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>seagoing, the lily  was quite suppressed and the rose had some ado<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>visibly  to flush through the tan.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>To one essentially such a novice in the  complexities of fact-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ious life, the abrupt transition from his former and simpler sphere<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to the ampler and more knowing world of a great warship; this<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>might well have abashed him had there been any conceit or vanity<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>in his composition. Among her miscellaneous multitude, the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><hi rend="italic">Indomitable</hi> mustered several  individuals who however inferior<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>in grade were of no common natural stamp, sailors more signally<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>susceptive of that  air which continuous martial discipline and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>repeated presence in battle can in some degree impart even to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the average man. As the <hi rend="italic">handsome sailor</hi> Billy Budd&#x0027;s position<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>aboard the seventy-four was something analogous to that of a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>rustic beauty transplanted from the provinces and brought into<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n19" n="145"/></div>
<div class='line'>competition with the high-born dames  of the court. But this<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>change  of circumstances  he scarce noted. As little did he observe<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>that something about him provoked an ambiguous  smile in one<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>or two harder faces among the blue-jackets.  Nor less unaware<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was he of the peculiar favorable effect his person and demeanor<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>had upon the more intelligent gentlemen of the quarter-deck. <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Nor could this well have been otherwise. Cast in a mould peculiar<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to the finest physical examples of those  Englishmen in whom the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Saxon strain would seem not at all to partake of any Norman or<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>other  admixture, he showed in face that  humane look of repose-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ful good nature which the Greek sculptor in some instances  gave<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to his heroic strong man,  Hercules. But this again was subtly<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>modified by another and pervasive quality.  The ear, small and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>shapely, the arch of the foot, the curve in mouth and nostril, even<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the indurated hand dyed to the orange-tawny of the toucan&#x0027;s bill,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a hand telling alike of the halyards and tar-bucket; but, above<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>all, something in the mobile expression, and every chance attitude<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and movement, something suggestive of a mother eminently<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>favored by Love and the Graces; all this strangely  indicated a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>lineage in direct contradiction to his  lot. The mysteriousness<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>here,  became less mysterious through a matter-of-fact elicited<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n20" n="146"/></div>
<div class='line'>when Billy at the capstan was  being formally mustered into the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>service. Asked by the officer, a small brisk little gentleman as it<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>chanced  among other questions, his place of birth, he replied,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>&#x201C;Please, Sir, I don&#x0027;t know.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Don&#x0027;t know where you were born?&#x2014;-Who was your<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>father? &#x003C;&#x201D;&#x003E;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;God knows, Sir.&#x201D; </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Struck by the straightforward simplicity of these replies, the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>officer next asked &#x201C;Do you know anything about your beginning?&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;No, Sir. But I have heard that I was found in a pretty silk-lined<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>basket  hanging one morning from the knocker of a good man&#x0027;s<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>door in Bristol &#x003C;.&#x003E;&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Found</hi> say you? Well,&#x201D; throwing back his head and looking up<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and down the new recruit; &#x201C;Well it turns out to have been a pretty<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>good find. Hope they&#x0027;ll find some more like you, my man; the fleet<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sadly needs them.&#x201D; </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Yes, Billy Budd was a foundling, a presumable bye-blow, and,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>evidently, no ignoble one. Noble  descent was as evident in him<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>as in a blood horse.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>For the rest, with little or no sharpness of faculty or any trace of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the wisdom of the serpent,  nor yet quite a dove, he possessed<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>that kind and degree of intelligence going along with the uncon-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ventional rectitude of a sound human creature, one  to whom not<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>yet has been proffered the questionable  apple of knowledge. He<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was illiterate; he could not read, but he could sing, and like the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n21" n="147"/></div>
<div class='line'>illiterate nightingale was sometimes the composer of his own<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>song.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Of self-consciousness he seemed to have little or  none, or<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>about as much as we may reasonably impute to a dog of St.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Bernard&#x0027;s breed. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Habitually being with the elements and knowing little more of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the land than as a beach, or, rather, that portion of the terraqueous<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>globe providentially set apart for dance-houses doxies and tap-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sters, in short what sailors call a &#x201C;fiddlers&#x0027; green,&#x201D; his simple<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>nature remained unsophisticated by those  moral obliquities<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>which are not in every case incompatible with that manufacturable<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>thing known as respectability. But are sailors, frequenters of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>&#x201C;fiddlers&#x0027; greens&#x201D;,  without vices? No; but less often than with<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>landsmen do their vices, so called,  partake of crookedness  of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>heart, seeming less to proceed from viciousness than  exuber-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ance of vitality after long constraint; frank manifestations in ac-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cordance with natural law. By his original constitution aided by<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the co&#x00F6;perating influences of his lot, Billy in many respects, was<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>little more than a sort of  upright barbarian, much such perhaps<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>as Adam presumably might have been ere the urbane Serpent<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>wriggled  himself into his company.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>And here be it submitted that apparently going to corroborate<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the doctrine of man&#x0027;s fall, a doctrine now popularly ignored, it<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>is observable that where certain virtues pristine and unadulterate<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n22" n="148"/></div>
<div class='line'>peculiarly characterize  anybody in the external uniform of civi-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>lization, they  will upon scrutiny seem not to be derived from<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>custom or convention but rather to be out of keeping with these, <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>as if indeed exceptionally transmitted from a period prior to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Cain&#x0027;s city  and citified man. The character marked by such quali-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ties  has to an unvitiated taste an untampered-with flavor like<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>that of berries while the man thoroughly civilized even in a fair<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>specimen of the breed  has to the same moral palate a question-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>able smack as of a  compounded wine. To any stray inheritor of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>these primitive qualities found, like Caspar Hauser, wandering<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>dazed in any Christian capital of our time the good-natured <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>poet&#x0027;s famous invocation, near two thousand years ago, of the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>good rustic out of his latitude in the Rome of the Caesars,  still<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>appropriately holds:&#x2014;</p></div>
<div class='line'><lg type="verse"></div>

<div class='line'><l>What has Thee, Fabian, to the city brought.&#x201D;</l></div>
<div class='line'></lg></div>
<div class='line'><p>Though our Handsome Sailor had as much of masculine beauty<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>as one can expect anywhere to see; nevertheless, like the beauti-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ful woman in one of Hawthorne&#x0027;s minor tales, there was just one<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>thing amiss in him. No visible blemish, indeed, as with the lady;<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>no, but an occasional  liability to a vocal defect. Though in the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n23" n="149"/></div>
<div class='line'>hour of elemental uproar or peril, he was everything that a sailor<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>should be, yet under sudden provocation of strong heart-feeling<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>his voice otherwise singularly musical, as if expressive  of the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>harmony within, was apt to  develop an organic hesitancy, in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>fact more or less of a stutter  or even worse.  In this particular<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Billy was a striking instance that the arch interferer, the envious<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>marplot of Eden still has more or less to do with every human<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>consignment to this planet of earth. In every case, one way or an-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>other he is sure to slip in his little card, as much as to remind us&#x2014;<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>I too have a hand here. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>The avowal of such an imperfection in the Handsome Sailor<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>should be evidence not alone that he  is not presented as a con-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ventional hero, but also that the story in which he is the main<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>figure is no romance.</p></div>

<div class='line'><p>At the time of Billy Budd&#x0027;s arbitrary enlistment into the <hi rend="italic">In-<lb/></div>

<div class='line'>fleet. No long time  elapsed before the junction was effected. As<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>one of that fleet the seventy-four  participated in its movements,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>though at times on account of her superior sailing qualities, in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the absence of frigates, despatched on separate duty as a scout<lb/></div>

<div class='line'>tion of his person in battle was not only  unnecessary, but not<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>military, nay, savored of foolhardiness and vanity. They may add,<lb/></div>

<div class='line'>the victorious admiral  might possibly have survived the battle,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and so, instead of having his sagacious dying injunction  over-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ruled by his immediate successor in command he himself when<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the contest was decided might have brought his shattered fleet<lb/></div>

<div class='line'><p>Yes, the outbreak  at the Nore was put down. But not every<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>grievance was redressed. If the contractors, for example, were no<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>longer permitted to ply some practices peculiar to their tribe<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>everywhere,  such as providing shoddy cloth, rations not sound, or<lb/></div>

<div class='line'>sable fleet, one wholly under  canvas, no steam-power, its innu-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>merable sails and thousands of cannon, everything in short,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>worked by muscle alone; a fleet the more insatiate in demand for<lb/></div>

<div class='line'><p>Discontent foreran the Two Mutinies, and more or less it lur-<lb/></div>

<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n33" n="159"/></div>
<div class='line'>hend  some return of trouble sporadic or general. One instance<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of such apprehensions: In the same year with this story,  Nelson,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>then Vice-Admiral Sir Horatio, being with the fleet off the Span-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ish coast, was directed by the Admiral in command to shift his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>pennant from the <hi rend="italic">Captain</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">Theseus</hi>; and for this reason: that<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the latter ship having newly arrived in the station from home<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>where it had taken part in the Great Mutiny,  danger was appre-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>hended  from the temper of the men; and it was thought that<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>an officer like Nelson was the one, not indeed to terrorize  the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>crew into base subjection, but to win them, by force of his mere<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>presence back to an  allegiance if not as enthusiastic as his own,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>yet as true.  So it was that for a time on more than one quarter-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>deck anxiety did exist. At sea precautionary vigilance was strained<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>against relapse. At short notice an engagement might come on.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>When it did,  the lieutenants assigned to batteries felt it incum-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>bent on them, in some instances  to stand with drawn swords<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>behind the men working the guns.</p></div>

<div class='line'>hammock, very  little in the manner  of the men and nothing ob-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>vious  in the demeanor of the officers would have suggested to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>an ordinary observer that the Great Mutiny was a recent event.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>In their general bearing and conduct the commissioned officers of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a warship naturally take their tone from the commander, that is<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>if he has that ascendancy of character that ought to be his. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Captain the Honorable Edward Fairfax Vere, to give his full<lb/></div>

<div class='line'>tion even in a time prolific of renowned seamen.  Though allied<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to the higher  nobility his advancement had not been altogether<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>owing to influences connected with that circumstance. He had<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>seen much service, been in various  engagements, always ac-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>quitting himself as an officer mindful of the welfare of  his men,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>but never tolerating an infraction of discipline;  thoroughly<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>versed in the science of his profession, and  intrepid to the verge<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of temerity, though  never injudiciously so.  For his gallantry<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n35" n="161"/></div>
<div class='line'>in the West Indian waters as flag-lieutenant under Rodney in that<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Admiral&#x0027;s crowning victory over De Grasse, he was made a post-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>captain.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Ashore in the garb of  a civilian scarce any one would have<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>taken him for a sailor, more especially that he never garnished <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>unprofessional talk with nautical terms, and grave in his bearing,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>evinced little appreciation of mere humor. It was not out of keep-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ing with these traits that on a passage when nothing demanded<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>his paramount action, he was the most undemonstrative of men.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Any landsman observing this gentleman not conspicuous by his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>stature and wearing no pronounced insignia, emerging from his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cabin  retreat to the open deck and noting the silent deference of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the officers retiring to leeward, might have taken him for the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>King&#x0027;s  guest, a civilian aboard the King&#x0027;s ship&#x003C;,&#x003E; some highly<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>honorable discreet envoy on his way to an important post. But<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>in fact this unobtrusiveness of demeanor may have  proceeded from<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a certain unaffected modesty of manhood sometimes  accompa-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>nying a resolute nature, a modesty evinced at all times not call-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ing for pronounced action, and which shown in any rank of life<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>suggests a virtue aristocratic in kind.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>As with some others engaged in various departments of the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>world&#x0027;s more heroic activities, Captain Vere though practical<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>enough upon occasion would at times betray a certain dreaminess<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of mood. Standing alone on the weather-side of the quarter-deck,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>one hand holding by the rigging he would absently gaze  off at<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the blank sea. At the presentation to him then of some minor mat-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n36" n="162"/></div>
<div class='line'>ter interrupting the current of his thoughts he would show more<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>or less irascibility; but  instantly he would control it.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>In the navy he was popularly known by the appellation&#x2014;Starry<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Vere. How such a designation happened to fall upon one who<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>whatever his sturdy qualities was without brilliant ones  was in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>this wise: a favorite kinsman, Lord Denton, a free-handed fel-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>low,  had been the first to meet and congratulate him upon his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>return to England from the West Indian cruise; and but the day<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>previous turning over a copy of Andrew Marvell&#x0027;s poems had<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>lighted, not for the first time however, upon the lines entitled<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><hi rend="italic">Appleton House</hi>, the name of  one of the seats of their common<lb/></div>

<div class='line'><p>In view of the part that the commander of the <hi rend="italic">Indomitable</hi><lb/></div>
<div class='line'>plays in scenes shortly to follow, it may be well to fill out that <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sketch of him outlined in the previous chapter. Aside from his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>qualities as a sea-officer  Captain Vere was an exceptional charac-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ter.  Unlike no few of England&#x0027;s renowned sailors, long and ardu-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ous service with signal  devotion to it, had not resulted in absorb-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ing and <hi rend="italic">salting</hi> the entire man. He had a marked leaning towards<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>everything intellectual. He loved books, never going to sea with-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>out a newly replenished library, compact but of the best. The<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>isolated leisure, in some cases so wearisome, falling at intervals<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to commanders even during a war-cruise, never was tedious to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Captain Vere. With nothing of that literary taste which less heeds<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the thing conveyed than the vehicle,  his bias was towards those<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>books to which every serious mind of superior order occupying<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>any active  post of authority in the world, naturally inclines; <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>books treating of actual  men and events no matter of what era&#x2014;<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>history, biography and unconventional writers, who, free from<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n38" n="164"/></div>
<div class='line'>cant and convention, like Montaigne, honestly, and in the spirit<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of common sense philosophize upon realities. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>In this love of reading he found confirmation of his own more<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>reserved thoughts&#x2014;confirmation which he had vainly sought in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>social converse, so that as touching most fundamental topics, there<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>had got to be  established in him some positive convictions which<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>he forefelt would abide in him essentially unmodified so long as<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>his intelligent part remained unimpaired.  In view of the trou-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>bled period in which his lot was cast  this was well for him. His<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>settled  convictions were as a dyke against those invading waters<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of novel opinion social political and otherwise,  which carried<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>away as in a torrent  no few minds in those days, minds by na-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ture not inferior to his own. While other members of that aristoc-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>racy to which by birth  he belonged were incensed at the innova-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tors mainly because their theories were inimical to the privileged<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>classes, not alone Captain Vere disinterestedly opposed them be-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cause they seemed to him incapable of embodiment in lasting in-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>stitutions,  but at war with the peace of the world and the true<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>welfare of mankind. </p></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n39" n="165"/></div>
<div class='line'><p>With minds less stored than his and less earnest,  some officers<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of his rank, with whom at times he would necessarily consort,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>found him lacking in the companionable  quality, a dry and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>bookish gentleman  as they deemed. Upon any  chance with-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>drawal from their company one would be apt to say to another<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>something like this: &#x201C;Vere is a noble fellow, Starry Vere. &#x2018;Spite<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the gazettes, Sir Horatio&#x201D; meaning him with the Lord title  &#x201C;is<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>at bottom scarce a better seaman or fighter. But between you and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>me now don&#x0027;t you think there is a queer streak of the pedantic<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>running through  him? Yes, like the King&#x0027;s yarn in a coil of navy-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>rope?&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Some apparent ground there was for this sort of confidential<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>criticism; since  not only did the Captain&#x0027;s discourse never fall<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>into the jocosely familiar, but in illustrating any point touching<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the stirring personages and events of the time he would be as apt<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to cite some historic character or incident of antiquity &#x003C;as&#x003E; he<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>would &#x003C;to&#x003E;  cite from the moderns. He seemed unmindful of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the circumstance that to his bluff company such remote  allusions<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>however pertinent they might really  be were altogether alien<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to men whose reading was mainly confined to the journals.  But<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>considerateness in such matters is not easy to natures  constituted<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>like Captain Vere&#x0027;s. Their honesty prescribes to them directness,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n40" n="166"/></div>
<div class='line'>sometimes far-reaching like that of a migratory fowl that in its<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>flight never heeds  when it crosses a frontier. </p></div>

<div class='line'><p>The lieutenants and other commissioned gentlemen forming<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Captain Vere&#x0027;s  staff it is not necessary here to particularize nor<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>needs it to make any mention of any of the warrant-officers. But<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>among the petty officers was one who having much to do with the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>story, may as well be forthwith introduced.  This portrait I essay,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>but shall never  hit it. This was John  Claggart, the master-at-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>arms. But that sea-title  may to landsmen seem somewhat equiv-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ocal. Originally doubtless that petty-officer&#x0027;s function  was the in-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>struction of the men in the use of arms, sword or cutlass. But very<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>long ago, owing to the advance in gunnery making hand-to-hand<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>encounters less frequent and giving to nitre and sulphur the pre-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>eminence over steel, that function ceased; the master-at-arms of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a great warship becoming a sort of Chief of Police charged among<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>other matters  with the duty of preserving order on the populous<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>lower gun-decks.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Claggart was a man of about five-and-thirty,  somewhat spare<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and tall, yet of no ill figure upon the whole. His hand was too<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>small and shapely to have been accustomed to hard toil. The<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>face was a notable one; the features all except the chin  cleanly<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n42" n="168"/></div>
<div class='line'>cut as those on a  Greek medallion; yet the chin, beardless as<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Tecumseh&#x0027;s, had something of the strange protuberant heaviness <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>in its make that recalled the prints of the Rev.  Dr. Titus Oates,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the historic deponent with the clerical drawl  in the time of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Charles II and the fraud of  the alleged Popish Plot. It served<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Claggart in his office  that his eye could cast a tutoring glance.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>His brow of the sort phrenologically associated with more than<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>average intellect;  silken jet curls partly clustering  over it, mak-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ing a foil to the pallor below, a pallor tinged with a faint shade of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>amber skin to the hue of time-tinted marbles of old.  This com-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>plexion, singularly contrasting with the red or deeply bronzed <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>visages of the sailors, and in part the result of his official seclusion<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>from the sunlight, though it was not exactly displeasing, never-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>theless seemed to hint of something defective or abnormal in the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>consititution and blood. But his general  aspect and manner<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>were so suggestive of an education and career incongruous with<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>his naval function  that when not actively engaged in it he looked<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>like a man of high quality, social and moral, who for reasons of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>his own was keeping <hi rend="italic">incog</hi>.  Nothing was known of his former<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>life. It  might be that he was an Englishman; and yet there<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>lurked a bit of accent in his speech suggesting that possibly he<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n43" n="169"/></div>
<div class='line'>was not such by birth, but through naturalization in early  child-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>hood. Among certain grizzled sea-gossips of the gun-decks and <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>forecastle went a rumor perdue that the  master-at-arms was a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><hi rend="italic">chevalier</hi> who had volunteered into the King&#x0027;s navy  by way of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>compounding for some mysterious swindle whereof he had been<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>arraigned at the King&#x0027;s Bench. The fact that  nobody could sub-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>stantiate this  report was, of course,  nothing against its secret<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>currency. Such  a rumor once started on the gun-decks in refer-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ence to almost anyone below the rank of a commissioned officer<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>would, during the period assigned to this narrative, have seemed<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>not altogether wanting in credibility  to the tarry old wiseacres<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of a man-of-war crew. And indeed a man of Claggart&#x0027;s accomplish-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ments, without prior  nautical experience entering the navy at<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>mature life, as he did, and necessarily allotted at the start to the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>lowest grade in it; a man too who never made allusion to his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>previous life ashore;  these were circumstances which in the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>dearth of exact knowledge as to his true antecedents opened to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the invidious a vague field for unfavorable  surmise.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>But the sailors&#x0027; dog-watch  gossip concerning him derived a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>vague plausibility from the fact  that now for some period the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n44" n="170"/></div>
<div class='line'>British Navy could so little afford to be squeamish in the matter<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of keeping up the  muster-rolls, that not only were press-gangs<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>notoriously abroad both afloat and ashore, but there was little<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>or no secret about another matter, namely  that the London<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>police were at liberty  to capture any able-bodied suspect, any<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>questionable fellow at large and summarily ship him to the dock-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>yard or fleet. Furthermore, even among voluntary enlistments<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>there were instances where the motive thereto partook neither of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>patriotic impulse nor yet of a random desire to experience a bit<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of sea-life and martial adventure. Insolvent debtors of minor<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>grade, together with the promiscuous lame ducks of morality<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>found in the navy a convenient and secure refuge.  Secure, be-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cause once enlisted aboard a King&#x0027;s-Ship, they were as much in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sanctuary, as the transgressor of the middle ages harboring him-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>self under the shadow of the altar.  Such sanctioned irregulari-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ties  which for obvious reasons the Government would hardly<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>think to parade at the time and which consequently, and as af-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>fecting the least influential class of mankind, have all but dropped<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>into oblivion lend  color to something for the truth whereof I<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>do not vouch, and hence have some scruple in stating; something<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>I remember having seen in print, though the book I cannot recall;<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>but the same thing was personally communicated to me now more<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>than forty years ago by an old pensioner in a cocked hat with<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>whom I had a most interesting talk on the terrace at Greenwich,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n45" n="171"/></div>
<div class='line'>a Baltimore negro, a Trafalgar man. It  was to this effect: In the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>case of a warship  short of hands whose speedy sailing was im-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>perative, the deficient quota in lack of any other way of making<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>it good,  would be eked out by drafts called direct from the jails.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>For reasons previously suggested it would not perhaps be very<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>easy at the present day directly to prove or disprove the allega-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tion. But allowed as a verity, how significant would it be of Eng-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>land&#x0027;s straits at the time confronted by those  wars which like<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a flight of harpies rose shrieking  from the din and dust of the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>fallen Bastille. That era  appears measurably clear to us who look<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>back at it, and but read of it. But to the grandfathers of us grey-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>beards,  the more thoughtful of them, the genius of  it presented<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>an aspect like that of Camo&#x00EB;ns&#x0027; Spirit of the Cape, an eclipsing<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>menace mysterious and prodigious. Not America was exempt<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>from apprehension. At the height of Napoleon&#x0027;s unexampled con-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>quests, there were Americans  who had fought at Bunker Hill<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>who looked forward to the possibility that the Atlantic might<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>prove no barrier against the ultimate schemes of this French por-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tentous upstart from the revolutionary chaos who seemed in act<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of fulfilling judgment prefigured  in the Apocalypse. </p></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n46" n="172"/></div>
<div class='line'><p>But  the less credence was to be given to the gun-deck talk<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>touching Claggart, seeing that no man holding his office in a man-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of-war can ever hope to be popular with the crew. Besides, in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>derogatory comments upon anyone against whom they have a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>grudge, or for any reason or no reason mislike, sailors are much <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>like landsmen, they are apt to exaggerate or romance it.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>About as much was really known to the <hi rend="italic">Indomitable&#x0027;s</hi> tars of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the master-at-arms&#x0027; career before entering the service as an as-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tronomer knows about a comet&#x0027;s travels prior  to its first ob-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>servable appearance in the sky. The verdict of the sea quid-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>nunc&#x0027;s  has been cited only by way of showing what sort of moral<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>impression the man made upon rude uncultivated natures whose<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>conceptions of human wickedness were necessarily of the nar-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>rowest, limited to ideas of vulgar rascality,&#x2014;a thief among the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>swinging hammocks during a night-watch, or the man-brokers and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>land-sharks of the sea-ports.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>It was no gossip, however, but fact, that though, as before<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>hinted, Claggart upon his entrance into the navy was, as a novice,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>assigned to the least honorable section of a man-of-war&#x0027;s crew,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>embracing the drudgery,  he did not long remain there.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>The superior capacity he immediately evinced, his constitu-<lb/></div>

<div class='line'>a peculiar ferreting genius manifested on a singular occasion, all<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>this capped by a certain austere patriotism abruptly advanced<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>him to the position of master-at-arms. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Of this maritime Chief of Police the ship&#x0027;s corporals, so called,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>were the immediate subordinates, and compliant ones; and this,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>as is to be noted in some business departments ashore, almost to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n47" n="173"/></div>
<div class='line'>a degree inconsistent with entire moral volition. His place put<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>various converging wires of underground influence under  the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Chief&#x0027;s control, capable when astutely worked through his under-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>strappers of operating to the mysterious discomfort if nothing<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>worse, of any of the sea-commonalty.</p></div>

<div class='line'><head>9</head></div>
<div class='line'><p>Life in  the foretop well agreed with Billy Budd. There, when not<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>actually engaged on the yards yet higher aloft, the topmen, who<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>as such had been picked out for youth and activity,  constituted<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>an aerial club lounging at ease against the smaller stunsails rolled<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>up into cushions, spinning yarns like the lazy gods, and frequently<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>amused with  what was going on in the busy world of the decks<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>below. No wonder then that a young fellow of Billy&#x0027;s disposition<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was well content in such society. Giving no cause of offense to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>anybody, he was always alert at a call.  So in the merchant serv-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ice it had  been with him. But now such punctiliousness in duty<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was  shown that his topmates would sometimes good-naturedly<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>laugh at him for it. This heightened alacrity had its cause, namely,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the impression made upon him by the first formal gangway-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>punishment he had ever witnessed, which befell the day following<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>his impressment. It had been incurred by a little fellow, young,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a novice  an after-guardsman absent from his assigned post when<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the ship was being put about; a dereliction  resulting in a rather<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>serious hitch to that maneuver, one demanding instantaneous<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>promptitude in letting go and making fast. When Billy saw the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n49" n="175"/></div>
<div class='line'>culprit&#x0027;s naked back under the scourge gridironed with red welts,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and worse; when he marked the dire  expression in the liberated<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>man&#x0027;s face as with his woolen shirt flung over him by the execu-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tioner  he rushed forward from the spot to bury himself in the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>crowd,  Billy was horrified. He resolved that never through re-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>missness would he make himself liable to such a visitation or do<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>or omit aught that might merit even verbal reproof. What then<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was his surprise and concern when ultimately he found himself<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>getting into petty  trouble occasionally about such matters as<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the stowage of his bag or something amiss in his hammock, mat-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ters under the police oversight of the ship&#x0027;s corporals of the lower<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>decks, and which brought down on him a vague threat from one<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of them.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>So heedful in all things as he was,  how could this be? He<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>could not understand it, and it more than vexed him. When he<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>spoke to his young  topmates about it they were either lightly<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>incredulous, or found something comical in his unconcealed <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>anxiety. &#x201C;Is it your bag, Billy?&#x201D; said one  &#x201C;well, sew yourself up<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>in it, bully boy, and then you&#x0027;ll be sure to know if anybody med-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>dles with it.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Now there was a veteran aboard who because his years began<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to disqualify him for more active work had been recently as-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>signed duty as mainmast-man in his watch, looking to the gear<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>belayed at the rail round about that great spar near the deck. At<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>off-times  the foretopman had picked up some acquaintance with<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n50" n="176"/></div>
<div class='line'>him, and now in his trouble it occurred to him that he might be<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the sort of person to go to for wise counsel. He was an old Dan-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sker long anglicized in the service, of few words, many wrinkles<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and some honorable scars. His wizened face, time-tinted and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>weather-stained to the complexion of  an antique parchment, <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was here and there peppered blue by the chance  explosion of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a gun-cartridge in action. He was an <hi rend="italic">Agamemnon</hi>-man;  some<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>two years prior to the time of this story having served under<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Nelson, when but Sir Horatio, in that  ship immortal in naval<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>memory, and which dismantled and in part broken up to her<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>bare  ribs is seen a grand skeleton in Haydon&#x0027;s etching. As one<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of a boarding-party from the <hi rend="italic">Agamemnon</hi> he had received a cut<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>slantwise along one temple and cheek, leaving a long pale scar<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>like a streak of dawn&#x0027;s light falling athwart the dark  visage. It<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was on account of that scar and the  affair in which it was known<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>that he had received it, as well as from his blue-peppered com-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>plexion  that the Dansker  went among the <hi rend="italic">Indomitable&#x0027;s</hi> crew<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>by the name of &#x201C;Board-her-in-the-smoke.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Now the first time that his small weazel-eyes happened to light<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>on Billy Budd, a certain grim internal merriment set all his an-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cient wrinkles into antic play. Was it that his eccentric unsenti-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>mental old sapience primitive in its kind  saw or thought it saw<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>something which in contrast with the warship&#x0027;s  environment<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n51" n="177"/></div>
<div class='line'>looked oddly incongruous in the handsome sailor? But after slyly<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>studying him at intervals, the old Merlin&#x0027;s equivocal merriment<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was modified; for now when  the twain would meet, it would<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>start in his face a quizzing sort of look, but it would be but mo-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>mentary and sometimes replaced by an expression of speculative<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>query  as to what might eventually befall a nature like that,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>dropped into a world not without some man-traps and against<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>whose subtleties simple courage lacking experience and address<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and without any touch of defensive ugliness, is of little avail; and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>where such innocence as man is capable of does yet in a moral<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>emergency not always sharpen the faculties or enlighten  the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>will.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>However it was the Dansker in his ascetic  way rather took<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to Billy. Nor was this only because of a certain philosophic inter-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>est in such a character. There was another cause.  While the old<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>man&#x0027;s eccentricities, sometimes bordering on the ursine, repelled<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the juniors, Billy, undeterred thereby, revering him as a salt hero <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>would make advances, never passing the old  Agamemnon-man<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>without a salutation marked by that respect which is seldom lost<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>on the aged however crabbed at times or whatever their station<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>in life. There was a  vein of dry humor, or what not, in the mast-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>man; and, whether in freak of patriarchal irony touching Billy&#x0027;s<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>youth and  athletic frame, or for some other and more recondite<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n52" n="178"/></div>
<div class='line'>reason, from the first  in addressing him he always  substituted<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Baby for Billy. The Dansker in fact being the originator of the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>name by which the foretopman eventually became known aboard<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ship. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Well then, in his mysterious little difficulty going in quest of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the wrinkled one,  Billy found him off duty in a dog-watch<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ruminating by himself seated on a shot-box of the upper gun-deck<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>now and then  surveying with a somewhat cynical regard certain<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of the more swaggering  promenaders there. Billy recounted his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>trouble, again wondering how it all happened. The salt seer at-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tentively listened, accompanying the foretopman&#x0027;s  recital with<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>queer twitching of his wrinkles and problematical little sparkles<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of his small ferret  eyes. Making an end of his story, the fore-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>topman asked, &#x201C;And now, Dansker,  do tell me what you think<lb/></div>

<div class='line'>they tell me.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n53" n="179"/></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Does he so?&#x201D;  grinned the grizzled one; then said &#x201C;Ay Baby<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Lad  a sweet voice has <hi rend="italic">Jemmy Legs</hi>.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;No, not always. But to me he  has. I seldom pass him but<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>there comes a pleasant word.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;And that&#x0027;s because he&#x0027;s down upon you, Baby Budd.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Such reiteration along with the manner of it, incomprehensible<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to a novice, disturbed Billy almost as much as the mystery for<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>which he had sought  explanation. Something less unpleasingly<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>oracular he tried to extract; but the old sea-Chiron thinking per-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>haps that for the nonce he had sufficiently instructed his young<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Achilles, pursed his lips, gathered his wrinkles together and would<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>commit himself to nothing further.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Years, and those experiences which befall certain shrewder <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>men subordinated life-long to the will of superiors, all this had<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>developed in the Dansker the pithy guarded cynicism that was<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>his leading characteristic. </p></div>

<div class='line'><p>The next day an  incident served to confirm Billy Budd in his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>incredulity as to the Dansker&#x0027;s  strange summing up of the case<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>submitted.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>The ship  at noon going large before the wind was rolling on<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>her course, and he  below at dinner and engaged in some sport-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ful talk with the members of his mess, chanced in a sudden lurch<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to spill the entire contents of his soup-pan upon the new <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>scrubbed deck. Claggart,  the master-at-arms, official rattan in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>hand, happened to be passing along the battery  in a bay of which<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the mess was lodged, and the greasy liquid streamed just across<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>his path. Stepping over it, he was proceeding on his way without<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>comment, since the matter was nothing to take notice of under<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the circumstances, when he happened to observe who it was that<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>had done the spilling. His countenance changed. Pausing, he was<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>about to ejaculate something hasty at the sailor, but checked<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>himself, and pointing down to the streaming soup, playfully<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tapped him from behind with his rattan,  saying in a low musical<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>voice peculiar to him at times  &#x201C;Handsomely done, my lad! And<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>handsome is as handsome did it  too!&#x201D; and with that passed on.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Not noted by Billy as not coming within his view was the in-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>voluntary smile, or rather grimace, that accompanied Claggart&#x0027;s<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n55" n="181"/></div>
<div class='line'>equivocal  words. Aridly it drew down  the thin corners of his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>shapely  mouth. But everybody taking his remark as meant  for<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>humorous, and at which therefore as coming from a superior<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>they were bound to laugh, &#x201C;with counterfeited glee&#x201D;  acted ac-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cordingly; and Billy  tickled, it may be, by the allusion to his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>being the handsome sailor, merrily joined in; then addressing his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>messmates exclaimed  &#x201C;There now, who says that <hi rend="italic">Jemmy Legs</hi><lb/></div>
<div class='line'>is down on me!&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;And who said he was, Beauty?&#x201D; demanded one Donald  with<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>some surprise. Whereat the foretopman looked a little foolish re-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>calling that it was only one person, Board-her-in-the-smoke who<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>had suggested what to him was the smoky idea that this  master-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>at-arms was in any peculiar  way hostile to him. Meantime that <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>functionary resuming his path must have momentarily worn some<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>expression less guarded than that of the bitter  smile and, usurp-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ing the face from the heart, some distorting expression perhaps <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>for a drummer-boy, heedlessly frolicking along from the opposite<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>direction, and chancing to come into light collision with his per-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>son was strangely disconcerted by his aspect. Nor was the impres-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sion lessened when the official, impulsively  giving him a sharp<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cut with the rattan, vehemently exclaimed &#x201C;Look where you go!&#x201D;</p></div>

<div class='line'><p>What was the matter with the master-at-arms? And, be the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>matter what it might, how could it have direct relation to Billy<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Budd with whom prior to the affair of the spilled soup he  had<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>never come into any special contact official or otherwise? What<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>indeed  could the trouble have to do with one so little inclined<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to give offense as  the merchant ship&#x0027;s <hi rend="italic">peacemaker</hi>, even  him<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>who in Claggart&#x0027;s own phrase was &#x201C;the sweet and pleasant young<lb/></div>

<div class='line'>sker&#x0027;s expression, be <hi rend="italic">down</hi> on the  Handsome Sailor? </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>But at heart and not for nothing, as the late chance encounter<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>may indicate to the discerning,  down on him, secretly down on<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>him, he assuredly was.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Now to invent something touching  the more private career of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Claggart, something involving Billy Budd,  of which something<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n57" n="183"/></div>
<div class='line'>the latter  should be wholly ignorant, some romantic incident<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>implying that Claggart&#x0027;s knowledge of the young blue-jacket began at some pe-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>riod anterior  to catching sight of him on board<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the seventy-four&#x2014;all this, not so  difficult to do, might avail in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a way more or less interesting  to account for whatever enigma<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>may appear to lurk in the case. But in fact there was nothing of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the sort. And yet the cause,  necessarily to be assumed as the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sole one assignable, is in its very  realism as much charged with<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>that  prime element of Radcliffian romance, <hi rend="italic">the mysterious</hi>, <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>as any that the ingenuity of the author of the <hi rend="italic">Mysteries of Udol-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>pho</hi> could devise. For  what can more partake of the mysterious<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>than an antipathy spontaneous and profound such as is evoked in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>certain exceptional mortals by the mere aspect of  some other<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>mortal, however harmless he may be? if not called forth by this<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>very harmlessness itself. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Now there can exist  no irritating juxtaposition of dissimilar<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>personalities comparable to that which is possible  aboard a great<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>warship fully manned and at sea. There, every day among all<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ranks  almost every man comes into more or less of contact with<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>almost every other man. Wholly there to avoid even  the sight<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of an aggravating object one must needs give it Jonah&#x0027;s toss or<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n58" n="184"/></div>
<div class='line'>jump overboard himself. Imagine how all this  might eventually<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>operate on some peculiar human creature the direct reverse of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a saint?</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>But for the adequate  comprehending of Claggart by a normal<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>nature  these hints are insufficient. To pass from a normal na-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ture  to him one must cross &#x201C;the deadly space between.&#x201D; And this<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>is best done by indirection.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Long ago an honest scholar my senior, said to me in reference<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to one  who like himself is now no more, a man so unimpeach-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ably respectable that against him nothing was ever openly said<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>though among the few something was whispered, &#x201C;Yes, X&#x2014;&#x2014;<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>is a nut not to be cracked by the tap of a lady&#x0027;s fan.  You are<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>aware that I am the adherent of no organized religion much less<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of any philosophy built into a system. Well, for all that, I think<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>that to try and get into X&#x2014;&#x2014;, enter his labyrinth and get out<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>again,  without a clue derived from some source other than what<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>is known as <hi rend="italic">knowledge of the world</hi>&#x2014;that were hardly possible,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>at least for me.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Why,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;X&#x2014;&#x2014;however singular a study to some, is yet<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>human, and knowledge of the world assuredly implies the knowl-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>edge of human nature, and in most of its varieties.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Yes, but a superficial knowledge of it, serving ordinary pur-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>poses. But for anything deeper, I am not certain whether to know<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the world and to know human nature be not two distinct branches<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of knowledge, which while they may coexist in the same heart,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n59" n="185"/></div>
<div class='line'>yet either may exist  with little or nothing of the other. Nay, in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>an average man of the world, his constant rubbing with it blunts<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>that fine spiritual insight indispensable to the understanding of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the essential in  certain exceptional characters, whether evil ones<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>or good. In a matter of some importance  I have seen a girl wind<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>an old lawyer about her little finger. Nor was it the dotage of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>senile love. Nothing of the sort. But he knew law better than he<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>knew the girl&#x0027;s heart. Coke and Blackstone hardly shed so much<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>light into obscure spiritual places  as the Hebrew prophets. And<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>who were they? Mostly recluses.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>At the time my inexperience was such that  I did not quite see<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the drift  of all this. It may be that  I see it now. And, indeed,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>if that lexicon which is based on Holy Writ were any longer popu-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>lar, one might with less difficulty define and denominate certain<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>phenomenal men.  As it is, one must turn to some authority not<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>liable to the charge of being tinctured with Biblical element.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>In a list of definitions included in the authentic translation of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Plato, a list attributed to him, occurs this: &#x201C;Natural Depravity:<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a depravity according to nature.&#x201D; A definition which though<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>savoring of Calvinism, by no means involves Calvin&#x0027;s dogma as to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>total mankind. Evidently its intent makes it applicable but to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>individuals. Not many are the examples of this depravity which<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the gallows and jail supply. At any rate for notable instances,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>since these have no vulgar alloy of the brute in them, but in-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>variably are dominated by intellectuality, one must go elsewhere.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Civilization, especially if of the austerer sort, is auspicious to  it.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n60" n="186"/></div>
<div class='line'>It folds itself in the mantle of respectability. It has its certain<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>negative  virtues serving as silent auxiliaries. It never allows wine<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to get within its guard. It is not going too far to say that it is<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>without vices or small sins. There is a phenomenal pride in it<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>that excludes them from anything mercenary or avaricious.  In<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>short the depravity here meant partakes nothing of the sordid or<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sensual. It is serious, but free from acerbity. Though no flatterer<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of mankind it never speaks ill of it.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>But the thing which in eminent instances signalizes so excep-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tional a  nature is this: though the man&#x0027;s even temper and dis-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>creet bearing would seem to intimate a mind peculiarly subject<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to the law  of reason, not the less in his heart  he would seem<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to riot in complete exemption from that law having apparently<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>little to do with reason further than to employ it as an ambidexter<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>implement for effecting the irrational. That is to say: toward the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>accomplishment of an aim which in wantonness of malignity<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n61" n="187"/></div>
<div class='line'>would seem to  partake of the insane, he will direct a cool judg-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ment sagacious and sound.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>These  men are true madmen, and of the most dangerous sort,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>for their lunacy is not continuous but occasional  evoked by<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>some special object; it is probably secretive which is as much to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>say it is self-contained, so that when moreover, most active it is<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to the average mind not distinguishable from sanity, and for the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>reason above suggested that whatever its aims may be, and the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>aim is never declared  the method and the outward proceeding<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>is always perfectly rational.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Now something such  was Claggart, in whom was the mania<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of  an evil nature, not engendered by vicious training or corrupt-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ing books or licentious living, but born with him  and innate, in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>short &#x201C;a depravity according to nature.&#x201D;</p></div>

<div class='line'><p>That Claggart&#x0027;s figure was not amiss, and his face, save the chin,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>well moulded, has already been said. Of these favorable points<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>he seemed not insensible, for he was not only neat but careful in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>his dress. But the form of Billy Budd was heroic; and if his face<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was without the intellectual look of the pallid Claggart&#x0027;s, not the<lb/></div>

<div class='line'><p>In view of the marked contrast between the persons of the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>twain, it is more than probable that when the master-at-arms in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the scene last given applied to the sailor the proverb <hi rend="italic">Handsome<lb/></div>

<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n65" n="191"/></div>

<div class='line'><p>Now envy and antipathy passions irreconcilable in reason,<lb/></div>

<div class='line'>an arraigned mortal has in hopes of mitigated penalty pleaded<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>guilty to horrible actions, did ever anybody seriously confess to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>envy? Something there is in it universally felt to be more shame-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ful than even felonious crime.  And not only does everybody dis-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>own it but the better sort  are inclined to incredulity when it is<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>in earnest  imputed to an intelligent man. But since its lodgment<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>is in the heart not the brain, no degree of intellect  supplies a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>guarantee against it.  But Claggart&#x0027;s was no vulgar form of the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>passion. Nor, as directed toward Billy Budd, did it partake of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>that streak of apprehensive jealousy which marred Saul&#x0027;s visage<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>perturbedly brooding on the comely young David. Claggart&#x0027;s<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>envy struck deeper. If askance he eyed the good looks, cheery<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n66" n="192"/></div>
<div class='line'>health and frank enjoyment of young life in Billy Budd, it was<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>because these went  along with  a nature that as Claggart mag-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>netically felt, had in its simplicity never willed malice or experi-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>enced the reactionary bite of that serpent.  To him, the spirit<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>lodged within Billy, and looking out from his welkin  eyes as<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>from windows, that ineffability  it was which made the dimple<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>in his dyed  cheek, suppled his joints, and dancing in his yellow<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>curls made him pre&#x00EB;minently  the Handsome Sailor. One person<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>excepted the master-at-arms was perhaps the only man in the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ship intellectually  capable of adequately  appreciating the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>moral phenomenon presented in Billy Budd. And the insight but<lb/></div>

<div class='line'>innocence&#x2014;to be nothing more than innocent! Yet in an aesthetic<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>way he saw the charm of it, the courageous  free-and-easy tem-<lb/></div>

<div class='line'><p>Passion, and passion in its profoundest, is not a thing demanding<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a palatial  stage whereon to play its part. Down among  the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>groundlings, among the beggars and rakers of the garbage, pro-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>found passion  is enacted. And the circumstances that provoke it,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>however trivial or mean,  are no measure of its power. In the pres-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ent instance the stage is a scrubbed gun-deck, and one of the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>external  provocations a man-of-war&#x0027;s man&#x0027;s  spilled soup.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Now when the master-at-arms noticed whence came that greasy<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>fluid streaming before his feet, he must have taken it&#x2014;to some<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>extent willfully,  perhaps not for the mere accident it assuredly <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was, but for the sly escape of a spontaneous feeling on Billy&#x0027;s<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>part more or less answering to the antipathy on his own. In effect<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a foolish demonstration he must have thought, and very harmless,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>like the futile kick of a heifer,  which yet were the heifer  a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>shod stallion would not be so harmless. Even so was it that into<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the gall of Claggart&#x0027;s envy he infused the vitriol of his  contempt.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n68" n="194"/></div>
<div class='line'>But  the incident confirmed to him certain tell-tale reports pur-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>veyed to his ear by <hi rend="italic">Squeak</hi>, one of his more cunning corporals,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a grizzled little man,  so nicknamed by the sailors on account of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>his squeaky voice, and sharp visage ferreting  about the dark<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>corners of the lower decks after interlopers, satirically suggesting<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to them the idea of a  rat in a cellar. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>From his chief&#x0027;s  employing him as an implicit tool in laying<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>little traps for the worriment of the foretopman&#x2014;for it was from<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the master-at-arms that the petty persecutions heretofore adverted<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to had proceeded&#x2014;  the corporal having naturally enough con-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cluded  that his master could have no love for the sailor, made it<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>his business, faithful understrapper that he was,  to foment the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ill blood by perverting to his chief certain innocent frolics of the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>good-natured foretopman,  besides inventing for his mouth <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sundry contumelious epithets he claimed to have overheard him<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>let fall.  The master-at-arms never suspected the veracity of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>these reports, more especially as to the epithets, for he well knew<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>how secretly unpopular may become a master-at-arms at least a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>master-at-arms of those days  zealous in his function, and how<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n69" n="195"/></div>
<div class='line'>the blue-jackets shoot at him in private their raillery and wit; the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>nickname by which he goes among them (<hi rend="italic">Jemmy Legs</hi>) imply-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ing under the form of merriment their cherished  disrespect and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>dislike. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>But in view of the greediness of hate for patrolmen it hardly<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>needed a purveyor to feed Claggart&#x0027;s passion. An uncommon pru-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>dence is habitual with  the subtler depravity, for it has every-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>thing to hide. And in case of an injury but suspected its secretive-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ness voluntarily cuts it off from enlightenment or disillusion; and,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>not unreluctantly,  action is taken upon surmise as upon cer-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tainty. And the retaliation is apt to be in monstrous  disproportion<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to the supposed offense; for when in anybody was revenge in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>its exactions aught else but an inordinate  usurer? But how with<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Claggart&#x0027;s  conscience? For though consciences are unalike as<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>foreheads, every intelligence, not excluding the Scriptural devils<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>who &#x201C;believe and tremble,&#x201D; has one.  But Claggart&#x0027;s conscience<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>being but the lawyer to his will, made ogres  of trifles, probably<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>arguing that the motive  imputed to Billy in spilling the soup<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>just  when he did, together with the epithets alleged, these, if<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>nothing more, made a strong case against him;  nay, justified<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>animosity into a sort of retributive righteousness. The Pharisee is<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n70" n="196"/></div>
<div class='line'>the Guy Fawkes prowling in the hid chambers underlying the <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Claggart&#x0027;s. And they can really  form no conception of an unre-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ciprocated malice. Probably, the master-at-arms&#x0027; clandestine per-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>secution of Billy was  started to try the temper of the man; but<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>it had not developed any quality in him that enmity could make<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>official  use of or even  pervert into even plausible self-justifica-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tion; so that the occurrence  at the mess, petty if it were,  was a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>welcome one to that peculiar conscience assigned to be the private<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>mentor of Claggart; and for the rest, not improbably it put him<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>upon new experiments. </p></div>

<div class='line'><div1 xml:id="t1-body-d16" type="chapter"></div>
<div class='line'><head>15</head></div>
<div class='line'><p>Not many days after the last incident narrated something befell<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Billy  Budd that more gravelled him than aught that had pre-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>viously occurred.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>It was a warm night for the latitude;  and the foretopman,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>whose watch at the time was properly  below, was dozing on the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>uppermost  deck whither he had ascended from his hot ham-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>mock one of hundreds suspended so closely wedged together over<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a  lower gun-deck that there was little or no swing to them. He<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>lay as in the shadow of a hill-side stretched under the lee of the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><hi rend="italic">booms</hi>, a piled ridge of spare spars amidships between foremast<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and mainmast and among which the ship&#x0027;s largest boat, the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>launch, was stowed. Alongside of three other slumberers from be-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>low, he lay near that end of the <hi rend="italic">booms</hi> which approached  from<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the foremast; his station aloft on duty as a foretopman being just <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>over the deck station of the forecastlemen entitling him according<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to usage to make himself more or less at home in that neighbor-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>hood.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Presently he was stirred into semi-consciousness by somebody,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>who must have previously sounded the sleep of the others, touch-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n72" n="198"/></div>
<div class='line'>ing his shoulder, and then as the foretopman raised his head,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>breathing into his ear in a quick whisper, &#x201C;Slip into the lee fore-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>chains, Billy; there is something in the wind. Don&#x0027;t speak. Quick.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>I will meet you there;&#x201D; and disappeared.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Now Billy  like sundry other essentially good-natured ones had<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>some of the weaknesses inseparable from essential good-na-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ture; and among these was a reluctance, almost an incapacity of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>plumply saying <hi rend="italic">no</hi> to an abrupt proposition not obviously absurd,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>on the face of it, nor obviously unfriendly, nor iniquitous. And be-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ing of warm blood he had not the phlegm tacitly to negative any<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>proposition by an unresponsive  inaction. Like his sense of fear, his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>apprehension as to aught outside of the honest and natural  was<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>seldom very quick. Besides, upon the present occasion, the drowse<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>from his sleep still hung upon him.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>However it was, he mechanically rose and, sleepily  wonder-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ing what could be in the wind, betook himself to the designated<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>place, a narrow platform, one of six,  outside of the high bul-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>warks and screened by the great dead-eyes and multiple columned<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>lanyards of the shrouds and back-stays; and, in a great warship<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of that time, of dimensions commensurate to the hull&#x0027;s magni-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tude;  a tarry balcony in short overhanging the sea, and so se-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cluded that one mariner  of the <hi rend="italic">Indomitable</hi>, a nonconformist old<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tar  of serious turn, made it even in daytime his private oratory.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>In this retired nook the stranger soon joined Billy Budd. There<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n73" n="199"/></div>
<div class='line'>was no moon yet; a haze obscured the starlight. He could not dis-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tinctly see the stranger&#x0027;s face. Yet from something in the outline<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and carriage, Billy took him to be, and correctly, one of the after-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>guard.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Hist! Billy,&#x201D; said the man; in the same quick cautionary whis-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>per as before &#x003C;,&#x003E; &#x201C;You were impressed, weren&#x0027;t you? Well, so<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was I;&#x201D; and he paused as to mark the effect. But Billy not knowing<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>exactly  what to make of this said nothing. Then the other: &#x201C;We<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>are not the only impressed ones, Billy. There&#x0027;s a gang of us.&#x2014;<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Couldn&#x0027;t you&#x2014;help&#x2014;at a pinch?&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;What do you mean?&#x003C;&#x201D;&#x003E; demanded Billy here shaking off his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>drowse. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Hist, hist!&#x201D; the hurried whisper now growing husky,  &#x201C;see<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>here;&#x201D; and the man held up two small objects faintly twinkling in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the night light; &#x201C;see, they are yours, Billy if you&#x0027;ll only&#x2014;&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>But Billy here broke in, and in his resentful  eagerness<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to deliver himself his vocal infirmity somewhat  intruded;<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>&#x201C;D-D-Damme,  I don&#x0027;t know what you are d-driving at, or what<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>you mean, but you had better g-g-go where you belong!&#x201D; For the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>moment the fellow, as confounded,  did not stir; and Billy, spring-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ing to his feet, said &#x201C;If you d-don&#x0027;t start I&#x0027;ll t-t-toss you back over<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the r-rail!&#x201D; There was no mistaking this and the mysterious emis-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sary decamped, disappearing in the direction of  the mainmast<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>in the shadow of the booms.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Hello, what&#x0027;s the matter?&#x201D; here came growling  from a fore-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n74" n="200"/></div>
<div class='line'>castleman awakened from his deck-doze by Billy&#x0027;s raised voice.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>And as the foretopman reappeared and was recognized by him;<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>&#x201C;Ah, <hi rend="italic">Beauty</hi>, is it you? Well, something must have been the matter<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>for you st-st-stuttered.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Oh,&#x201D; rejoined Billy, now  mastering the impediment; &#x201C;I found<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>an afterguardsman  in our part of the ship here and I bid him be<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>off where he belongs.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;And is that all you did about it, foretopman?&#x201D; gruffly de-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>manded another, an irascible old fellow of brick-colored visage<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and hair, and who was known to his associate forecastlemen  as<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><hi rend="italic">Red Pepper;</hi> &#x201C;Such sneaks I should like to marry to the gunner&#x0027;s<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>daughter!&#x201D; by that expression meaning that he would like to sub-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ject them to disciplinary castigation over a gun.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>However, Billy&#x0027;s  rendering of the matter satisfactorily ac-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>counted  to these inquirers, for the brief commotion since of all<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the sections of a ship&#x0027;s company the forecastlemen, veterans for<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the most part and bigoted in their sea-prejudices, are the most<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>jealous in resenting territorial encroachments, especially on the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>part of any of the afterguard, of whom they have but a sorry opin-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ion, chiefly landsmen, never going aloft except to reef or furl the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>mainsail, and in no wise competent to handle a marline-spike or<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>turn in a <hi rend="italic">dead-eye</hi>, say. </p></div>

<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n75" n="201"/></div>
<div class='line'><div1 xml:id="t1-body-d17" type="chapter"></div>
<div class='line'><head>16</head></div>
<div class='line'><p>This incident sorely puzzled Billy Budd. It was an entirely new<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>experience; the first time in his life that he had ever been per-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sonally approached in underhand intriguing fashion. Prior to this<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>encounter he had known nothing of the afterguardsman, the two<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>men being stationed wide apart, one forward and aloft during his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>watch, the other on deck and aft.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>What could it mean? And could they really be guineas, those<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>two glittering objects the interloper had held up to his (Billy&#x0027;s) <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>eyes? Where could the fellow get guineas? Why even buttons spare buttons<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>are not so plentiful at sea.  The more he turned the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>matter over, the more he was nonplussed, and made uneasy and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>discomfited. In his disgustful  recoil from an overture which<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>though he but ill comprehended he instinctively knew must in-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>volve evil of some sort, Billy Budd was like a young horse fresh<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>from the pasture suddenly inhaling a vile whiff of some chemical<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>factory and by repeated snortings trying to get it out of his nos-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>trils and lungs. This frame of mind barred  all desire of holding<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>further parley with the fellow, even were it but for the purpose of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>gaining some enlightenment as to his design in  approaching him.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>And yet he was not without natural curiosity to see how such a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>visitor in the dark would look in broad day.</p></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n76" n="202"/></div>
<div class='line'><p>He espied him the following afternoon in his first  dog-watch<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>below one of the smokers on that forward part of the upper gun-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>deck allotted to the pipe. He recognized him by his general cut <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and build, more than by his round freckled face and glassy eyes<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of pale blue, veiled  with lashes all but white. And yet Billy was<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a bit uncertain whether indeed it were he&#x2014;yonder chap  about his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>own age, chatting and laughing in free-hearted way, leaning<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>against a gun; a genial young fellow enough to look at, and some-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>thing of a rattle-brain, to all appearance. Rather chubby too for a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sailor even an afterguardsman. In short the last man in the world,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>one would think, to be overburdened with thoughts, especially<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>those perilous thoughts that must needs belong to a conspirator in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>any serious project, or even to the underling of such a conspir-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ator.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Although  Billy was not aware of it, the fellow, with one side-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>long watchful  glance had perceived Billy first, and then noting<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>that Billy  was looking at him, thereupon  nodded a familiar sort<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of friendly recognition as to an old acquaintance, without inter-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>rupting the talk he was engaged in with the group of smokers. A<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>day or two afterwards chancing in the evening  promenade on a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>gun-deck, to pass Billy, he offered a flying word of good-fellow-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ship as it were, which by its unexpectedness, and equivocalness<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>under the circumstances so embarrassed Billy that he knew not<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>how to respond to it, and let it go unnoticed. </p></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n77" n="203"/></div>
<div class='line'><p>Billy was now left more at a loss  than before. The ineffectual<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>speculations into which he was led were so disturbingly alien to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>him that he did his best to smother them. It never entered<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>his mind that here was a matter which from its extreme question-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ableness,  it was his duty as a loyal blue-jacket to report in the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>proper quarter. And, probably, had such a step been suggested to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>him he would have been deterred from taking it by the thought,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>one of novice-magnanimity, that it would savor overmuch of the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>dirty work of a tell-tale. He kept the thing to himself. Yet upon<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>one occasion, he could not forbear a little disburdening himself to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the old Dansker, tempted thereto perhaps by the influence of a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>balmy night when the ship lay becalmed;  the twain, silent for<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the most part, sitting together on deck, their heads propped<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>against the bulwarks. But it was only a partial and anonymous<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>account that Billy gave, the unfounded scruples above referred to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>preventing full disclosure to anybody. Upon hearing Billy&#x0027;s ver-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sion, the sage Dansker  seemed to divine more than he was told;<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and after a little meditation during which his wrinkles were<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>pursed as into a point, quite effacing for the time that quizzing<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>expression his face  sometimes wore,&#x2014;&#x201C;Didn&#x0027;t I say so, Baby<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Budd?&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Say what?&#x201D; demanded Billy.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Why, <hi rend="italic">Jemmy Legs</hi> is <hi rend="italic">down</hi> on you.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;And what&#x201D; rejoined Billy in amazement, &#x201C;has <hi rend="italic">Jemmy Legs</hi> to do<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>with that cracked afterguardsman?&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Ho, it was an afterguardsman, then. A cat&#x0027;s-paw, a cat&#x0027;s-paw!&#x201D;<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>And with that exclamation, which, whether it had reference to a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>light puff of air just then coming over the calm sea, or subtler re-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>lation to the afterguardsman, there is no telling, the old Merlin<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>gave a twisting wrench with his black teeth at his plug of to-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n78" n="204"/></div>
<div class='line'>bacco, vouchsafing no reply to Billy&#x0027;s impetuous question, though<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>now repeated, for it was his wont to relapse into grim silence<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>when interrogated in skeptical sort as to any of his sententious<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>oracles, not always very clear ones, but rather partaking of that <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>obscurity  which invests most Delphic deliverances from any<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>quarter. </p></div>

<div class='line'><p>Long experience had very likely brought this old man to that<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>bitter prudence which never interferes in aught and never gives<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>advice. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Yes, despite the Dansker&#x0027;s pithy insistence as to the master-at-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>arms being at the bottom of these strange experiences of Billy on<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>board the <hi rend="italic">Indomitable</hi>, the young sailor was ready to ascribe them<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to almost anybody but the man who, to use Billy&#x0027;s own expres-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sion, &#x201C;always had a pleasant word for him.&#x201D; This is to  be won-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>dered at. Yet not so much to be wondered at. In certain matters,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>some sailors even in mature life remain unsophisticated enough.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>But a young seafarer of the disposition of our athletic  foretopman<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>is much of a child-man. And yet a child&#x0027;s utter innocence is but<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>its blank  ignorance, and the innocence more or less  wanes as<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>intelligence waxes. But in Billy Budd intelligence such as it was,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>had advanced, while yet his simple-mindedness remained for the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>most part unaffected. Experience is a teacher indeed; yet did<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Billy&#x0027;s years make his experience small. Besides,  he had none of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>that intuitive knowledge of the bad which in natures not good or<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>incompletely so  foreruns experience, and therefore may pertain,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>as in some instances it too clearly does pertain,  even to youth.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>And what could Billy know of man except of man as a mere <lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n80" n="206"/></div>
<div class='line'>sailor? And the old-fashioned sailor, the veritable man-before-the-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>mast, the sailor from boyhood up, he, though indeed of the same<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>species as a landsman is in some respects singularly distinct from<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>him.  The sailor is frankness,  the landsman is finesse. Life is<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>not a game with the sailor, demanding the long head; no intricate<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>game of chess where few moves are made in straightforwardness,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and ends are attained  by indirection; an oblique, tedious, bar-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ren  game hardly worth that poor candle burnt out in playing it.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Yes,  as a class, sailors are in character a juvenile race. Even <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>their deviations are marked by juvenility. And this more espec-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ially holding true with the sailors of Billy&#x0027;s time. Then, too, cer-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tain things which apply to all sailors, do more pointedly operate<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>here and there, upon the junior one. Every sailor, too is  accus-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tomed to obey orders without debating them; his life afloat is ex-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ternally ruled for him; he is not brought into that promiscuous<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>commerce with mankind where unobstructed free agency on <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>equal terms&#x2014;equal superficially, at least&#x2014;soon teaches one that<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>unless upon occasion he exercises a distrust keen in proportion to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the fairness of the appearance, some foul turn may be served him.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>A ruled undemonstrative distrustfulness is so habitual, not with<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>business-men so much, as with men who know their kind in less<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>shallow relations than business, namely certain  men-of-the-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>world, that they come at last to employ it all but unconsciously;<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and some pi them would very likely feel real surprise at being<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>charged with it as one of their general characteristics.</p></div>

<div class='line'><head>18</head></div>
<div class='line'><p>But after the little matter at the mess Billy Budd no more<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>found himself in strange  trouble at times about his hammock or<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>his clothes-bag or what not. While, as to that smile that occasion-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ally sunned  him, and the pleasant passing word, these were if<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>not more frequent, yet if anything more pronounced than before.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>But for all that, there were certain other demonstrations now.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>When Claggart&#x0027;s unobserved glance happened to light on belted<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Billy rolling along the upper gun-deck in the leisure of the sec-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ond  dog-watch exchanging passing broadsides of fun with other<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>young promenaders in the crowd; that glance  would follow the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cheerful sea-Hyperion  with a settled meditative and melancholy<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>expression, his  eyes strangely suffused with incipient feverish<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tears. Then would Claggart look like the man of sorrows. Yes, <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and sometimes the melancholy expression  would have in it a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>touch of soft yearning, as if Claggart  could even have loved<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Billy but for fate and ban. But this  was an evanescence, and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>quickly repented of, as it were, by an immitigable look, pinching<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and shrivelling the visage into the momentary semblance of a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>wrinkled walnut. But sometimes catching sight in advance of the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n82" n="208"/></div>
<div class='line'>foretopman coming  in his direction, he would, upon their near-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ing, step aside a little to let him pass, dwelling upon Billy for the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>moment with the glittering dental satire of a Guise.  But upon<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>any abrupt unforeseen encounter a red light would flash forth<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>from his eye like a spark from an  anvil in a dusk smithy. That<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>quick fierce light was a strange one, darted from orbs which in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>repose were of a color nearest approaching a deeper violet, the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>softest of shades.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Though some of these caprices of the pit  could not but be<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>observed by their object, yet were they beyond the construing of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>such  a nature. And the <hi rend="italic">thews</hi>  of Billy were hardly compar-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>able  with that sort of sensitive spiritual organization which in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>some  cases instinctively conveys to ignorant innocence an ad-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>monition  of the proximity of the malign. He thought the master-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>at-arms acted in a manner rather queer at times. That was all.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>But the occasional frank air and pleasant word went for what they<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>purported to be, the young sailor never having heard as yet of <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the &#x201C;too fair-spoken man.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Had the foretopman been conscious of having done or said<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>anything to provoke the ill will of the official, it would have been<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>different with him, and his sight might have been purged if not <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sharpened. As it was innocence was his blinder.</p></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n83" n="209"/></div>
<div class='line'><p>So was it with him in yet another matter. Two  minor officers&#x2014;<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the Armorer, and Captain of the Hold,  with whom he had never<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>exchanged a word, his position on the ship not bringing him into<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>contact with them; these men now for the first began to cast<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>upon Billy when they chanced to encounter  him, that peculiar<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>glance  which evidences that the man from whom it comes has<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>been some way tampered with and to the prejudice of him upon<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>whom the glance lights. Never did it occur to Billy as a thing to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>be noted or a thing suspicious, though he well knew the fact that<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the Armorer and Captain of the Hold, with the ship&#x0027;s yeoman,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>apothecary and others of that grade,  were by naval usage, mess-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>mates of the master-at-arms men with ears convenient to his con-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>fidential  tongue. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>But the general popularity that our Handsome Sailor&#x0027;s  manly<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>forwardness upon occasion, and irresistible good nature indi-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cating no mental superiority  tending to excite an invidious<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>feeling;  this good  will on the part of most of his shipmates<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>made him the less to concern himself about such mute aspects<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>toward him as those whereto allusion has just been made as far<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>as he could not so fathom as to infer their whole import. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>As to the afterguardsman,  though Billy for reasons already<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>given necessarily saw little of him, yet when the two did happen<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n84" n="210"/></div>
<div class='line'>to meet, invariably came the fellow&#x0027;s offhand cheerful recogni-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tion, sometimes accompanied by a passing pleasant word or two. <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Whatever that equivocal young person&#x0027;s  original design may<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>really have been, or the design of which he might have been the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>deputy,  certain it was  from his manner upon these occasions,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>that he had wholly dropped it. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>It was as if his precocity of crookedness (and every vulgar vil-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>lain is precocious ) had for once deceived him, and the man he<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>had sought to entrap  as a simpleton had, through his very sim-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>plicity ignorantly  baffled him.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>But shrewd ones may opine that it was  hardly possible for<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Billy to refrain from  going up to the afterguardsman and bluntly<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>demanding to know his purpose in the initial interview, so ab-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ruptly closed in the fore-chains.  Shrewd ones may  also think it<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>but natural in  Billy to set about sounding some of the other <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>impressed men of the ship in order to discover what basis, if any,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>there was for the emissary&#x0027;s obscure suggestions as to plotting <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>disaffection aboard. Yes, &#x003C;the&#x003E; shrewd may  so think. But<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n85" n="211"/></div>
<div class='line'>something more, or rather,  something else than mere shrewd-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ness is perhaps needful for the due understanding of such a char-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>acter as Billy Budd&#x0027;s.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>As to Claggart, the monomania in the man&#x2014;if that indeed it<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>were&#x2014;as involuntarily disclosed by starts in the manifestations<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>detailed, yet in general covered over by his self-contained and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>rational demeanor; this,  like a subterranean fire was eating its<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>way deeper and deeper in him. Something decisive  must come<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of it.</p></div>
<div class='line'></div1></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n86" n="212"/></div>
<div class='line'><div1 xml:id="t1-body-d20" type="chapter"></div>
<div class='line'><head>19 </head></div>
<div class='line'><p>After the mysterious interview in the fore-chains, the one so<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>abruptly ended there by Billy,  nothing especially germane to the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>story occurred until the events now about to be narrated.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Elsewhere it has been said that owing to the lack of frigates (of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>course better sailers than line-of-battle ships) in the English<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>squadron up the Straits at  that period, the <hi rend="italic">Indomitable</hi>  was oc-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>casionally employed not only as an available substitute for a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>scout, but at times on detached service of more important kind.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>This was not alone because of her sailing qualities, not common<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>in a ship of her rate, but quite as much, probably, that the charac-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ter of her commander, it was thought,  specially adapted him for<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>any duty where under unforeseen difficulties a prompt initiative<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>might have to be taken in some matter demanding  knowledge<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and ability in addition to those qualities implied in good seaman-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ship.  It was on an expedition of the latter sort, a somewhat dis-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tant one, and when the <hi rend="italic">Indomitable</hi> was almost at her furthest<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n87" n="213"/></div>
<div class='line'>remove from the fleet  that in the latter part of an afternoon-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>watch she unexpectedly  came in sight of a ship of the enemy.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>It proved to be frigate. The latter, perceiving through the glass<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>that the weight of men and metal would be heavily against her,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>invoking her light heels crowded sail to get away. After a chase<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>urged almost against hope and lasting until about the middle of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the first dog-watch, she signally succeeded in effecting her escape.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Not long after the pursuit had been given up, and ere the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>excitement incident thereto  had altogether waned away, the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>master-at-arms ascending from his cavernous sphere made his ap-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>pearance cap in hand by the mainmast  respectfully awaiting the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>notice of Captain Vere then solitary walking the weather-side of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the quarter-deck doubtless somewhat  chafed at the failure of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the pursuit. The spot where Claggart stood was the place allotted<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to the men of lesser grades when seeking some more particu-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>lar interview either with the officer-of-the-deck or the Captain<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>himself.  But from the latter it was not often that a sailor or<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>petty-officer of those days  would seek a hearing; only some ex-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ceptional cause, would, according to established custom, have<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>warranted that.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Presently, just as the Commander absorbed in  his reflections<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was on the point of turning aft in his promenade, he became sen-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n88" n="214"/></div>
<div class='line'>sible of Claggart&#x0027;s presence, and saw the doffed cap held in def-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>erential expectancy. Here be it said that Captain Vere&#x0027;s personal<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>knowledge of this petty-officer had only begun at the time of the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ship&#x0027;s last sailing from home, Claggart then for the first, in trans-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>fer from a ship detained for repairs, supplying on board  the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><hi rend="italic">Indomitable</hi> the place of a previous master-at-arms disabled<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and  ashore.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>No sooner did the Commander observe who it was that now<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>so deferentially stood awaiting his  notice, than a peculiar ex-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>pression came over him.  It was not unlike that which uncon-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>trollably will flit across the countenance of one at unawares en-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>countering a person who though known to him indeed has hardly<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>been long enough known for thorough knowledge, but something<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>in  whose aspect nevertheless now for the first provokes  a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>vaguely repellent distaste.  But coming to a stand and resuming<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>much of his wonted official manner, save that a sort of impatience<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>lurked in the intonation of the opening word, he said, &#x201C;Well?<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>what is it, master-at-arms?&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>With the air of a subordinate grieved at the necessity of being<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a messenger of ill tidings, and while conscientiously determined<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to be frank, yet equally resolved upon shunning  overstatement,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Claggart at this invitation or rather summons to disburden, spoke<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n89" n="215"/></div>
<div class='line'>up. What he said, conveyed in the language of no uneducated<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>man, was to the effect following if not altogether in these words,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>namely,  that during the chase and preparations for the possible<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>encounter he had seen enough to convince him that at least one<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sailor aboard  was a dangerous character in a ship mustering<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>some who not only had taken a guilty part in the late serious<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>troubles, but others also who, like the man in question, had en-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tered His Majesty&#x0027;s service under another form than enlistment.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>At this point Captain Vere with some impatience, interrupted<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>him:</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Be direct, man; say impressed men.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Claggart made a gesture of subservience and proceeded.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Quite lately whereof  he (Claggart) had begun to suspect<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>that on the gun-decks  some sort of movement prompted by the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sailor in question  was covertly going on, but he had not thought<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>himself warranted in reporting the suspicion so long as it re-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>mained indistinct.  But from what he had that afternoon ob-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>served in the man referred to the suspicion of something clan-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>destine going on  had advanced to a point less removed from<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>certainty. He deeply felt, he added, the serious responsibility as-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sumed in making a report involving such possible consequences<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to the individual mainly concerned, besides tending to augment<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>those natural anxieties which every naval commander must feel<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>in view of extraordinary  outbreaks so recent as those which, he<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sorrowfully said it, it needed not to name.</p></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n90" n="216"/></div>
<div class='line'><p>Now at the first broaching of the matter Captain Vere taken by<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>surprise, could not wholly dissemble his disquietude. But as Clag-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>gart  went on, the former&#x0027;s  aspect changed into restiveness<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>under something in the witness&#x0027;s  manner in giving his testi-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>mony. However, he refrained from interrupting him. And Clag-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>gart, continuing, concluded with this: </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;God forbid, your honor,  that the <hi rend="italic">Indomitable&#x0027;s</hi> should be the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>experience of the&#x2014;&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Never mind that!&#x201D; here  peremptorily broke in the superior,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>his face altering with anger, instinctively  divining the ship that<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the other was about to name, one in which the Nore Mutiny had<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>assumed a singularly  tragical character that for a time jeopard-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ized the life of its Commander. Under the circumstances he <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was indignant at the purposed allusion. When the commissioned<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>officers themselves were on all occasions very heedful how they<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>referred to the recent events,  for a petty-officer unnecessarily to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>allude to them in the presence of his Captain, this struck him as <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a most immodest presumption. Besides, to his quick sense of self-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>respect, it even looked under the circumstances something  like<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n91" n="217"/></div>
<div class='line'>an attempt to alarm him. Nor at first  was he without some sur-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>prise that one  who so far as he had hitherto  come under his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>notice had shown considerable tact in his  function should in this<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>particular evince such lack of it. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>But these thoughts and kindred dubious ones flitting across <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>his mind were suddenly replaced by an intuitional surmise which<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>though as yet  obscure in form served practically to affect his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>reception of the ill tidings. Certain it is, that long versed in every-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>thing pertaining to the complicated gun-deck  life, which like<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>every other form of life has its secret mines and dubious  side <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the side popularly  disclaimed, Captain Vere did not permit him-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>self to be unduly disturbed by the general tenor of his subordi-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>nate&#x0027;s report. Furthermore,  if in view of recent events prompt<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>action should be taken at the first palpable sign of recurring in-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>subordination, for all that,  not judicious would it be,  he<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>thought, to keep the idea of lingering disaffection alive by undue<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>forwardness in crediting an informer  even if his own subordinate<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and charged among other things  with police surveillance  of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n92" n="218"/></div>
<div class='line'>the crew. This feeling would not perhaps have so prevailed with<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>him  were it not that upon a prior  occasion the patriotic zeal<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>officially evinced by  Claggart had somewhat  irritated him <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>as appearing rather  supersensible and strained. Furthermore <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>something even in the official&#x0027;s self-possessed and somewhat os-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tentatious  manner in making his specifications strangely  re-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>minded him  of a bandsman, a perjured witness in a capital case<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>before a perjurous  court-martial ashore  of which when a lieu-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tenant he Captain Vere  had been a member.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Now the peremptory check given to Claggart  in the matter of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the arrested allusion was quickly followed up by this:  &#x201C;You say<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>that there is at least one dangerous man aboard. Name him.&#x201D; </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;William Budd. A foretopman, your honor&#x2014;&#x201D; </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;William Budd&#x201D; repeated Captain Vere with unfeigned aston-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ishment;  &#x201C;and mean you the man  that Lieutenant Ratcliffe<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>took from the merchantman not very long ago &#x2014;the young fel-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n93" n="219"/></div>
<div class='line'>low who seems to be so popular with the men&#x2014;Billy, the Hand-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>some Sailor, as they call him?&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;The same, your honor;  but for all his youth and good looks, a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>deep one. Not for nothing does he insinuate himself into the good<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>will of his shipmates, since at the least all hands will at a pinch<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>say a good word for him at all hazards.  Did Lieutenant Rat-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cliffe happen to tell your honor  of that adroit fling of Budd&#x0027;s <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>jumping up in the cutter&#x0027;s bow under the merchantman&#x0027;s stern<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>when he was being taken off? It is even masqued by that sort of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>good-humored air that at heart  he resents his impressment. You<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>have but noted his fair cheek. A man-trap may be under his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ruddy-tipped daisies.&#x201D; </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Now the Handsome Sailor as a signal figure among the crew,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>had naturally enough attracted the Captain&#x0027;s attention from the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>first. Though in general  not very demonstrative to his officers,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>he had congratulated Lieutenant Ratcliffe upon his good fortune<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>in lighting on such a fine specimen of the genus homo who, in the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>nude might have posed for a statue of young Adam before the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>fall. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>As to Billy&#x0027;s adieu to the ship <hi rend="italic">Rights-of-Man</hi>, which the board-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ing lieutenant had indeed reported to him&#x003C;,&#x003E; Captain Vere, but<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>in a deferential way  more as a good story than aught else, though<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n94" n="220"/></div>
<div class='line'>mistakenly understanding it as a satiric sally,  had but thought<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>so much the better of the impressed man  for it; as a military<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sailor, admiring the spirit that could take an arbitrary enlistment<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>so merrily and sensibly. The foretopman&#x0027;s  conduct, too, so far<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>as it had fallen under the Captain&#x0027;s notice had confirmed the first<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>happy augury,  while the new recruit&#x0027;s qualities as a <hi rend="italic">sailor-man</hi><lb/></div>
<div class='line'>seemed to be such that he had thought of recommending him to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the executive officer for promotion to a place that would more fre-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>quently bring him under his own observation, namely, the cap-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>taincy of the mizzen-top, replacing there in the starboard watch<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a man not so young whom partly for that reason he deemed less<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>fitted for the post. Be it parenthesized here  that since the mizzen-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>top-men have not to handle such breadths of heavy canvas as the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>lower  sails on the main-mast and fore-mast, a young man if of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the right stuff not only seems best adapted to duty there, but in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>fact is generally selected for the captaincy of that top, and the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>company under him are  light hands and often but striplings. In<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sum, Captain Vere had from the beginning deemed Billy Budd to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>be what in the naval parlance of the time was called a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">King&#x0027;s<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>bargain</hi>,&#x201D; that is to say, for His Britannic Majesty&#x0027;s navy a capital<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>investment at small outlay or none at all. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>After a brief pause during which the reminiscences above men-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tioned passed vividly through his mind he weighed the import of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Claggart&#x0027;s last suggestion, conveyed in the phrase, &#x201C;pitfall under<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the clover,&#x201D;  and the more he weighed it the less reliance he felt<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n95" n="221"/></div>
<div class='line'>in the informer&#x0027;s good faith. Suddenly he turned upon him and in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a low voice:  &#x201C;Do you come to me, master-at-arms, with so foggy<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a tale? As to Budd, cite  me an act or spoken word of his  con-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>firmatory of what you in general  charge  against him. Stay,&#x201D;<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>drawing nearer to him  &#x201C;heed what you speak. Just now and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>in  a case like this, there is a yard-arm-end for the false-witness.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Ah, your honor!&#x201D; sighed Claggart mildly shaking his shapely<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>head as in sad deprecation of such unmerited severity of tone.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Then, bridling&#x2014;erecting himself as in virtuous self-assertion, he<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>circumstantially alleged certain  words and acts, which collec-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tively  if credited, led to presumptions mortally inculpating<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Budd. And  for some of these averments, he added, substan-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tiating proof was not far.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>With grey eyes impatient and distrustful essaying to fathom to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the bottom Claggart&#x0027;s calm violet ones, Captain Vere again heard<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>him out;  then for the moment stood ruminating. The mood he<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>evinced, Claggart&#x2014;himself for the time liberated from the oth-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>er&#x0027;s  scrutiny&#x2014;steadily regarded with a look difficult to render,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>&#x2014;a look curious of the operation of his tactics, a look such as<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>might have been that of the spokesman of the envious children of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Jacob deceptively imposing upon the troubled patriarch the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>blood-dyed coat of young Joseph. </p></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n96" n="222"/></div>
<div class='line'><p>Though something exceptional in the moral quality of Captain<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Vere made him, in earnest encounter with a fellow-man, a veri-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>table touch-stone of that man&#x0027;s essential nature, yet now as to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Claggart and what was really  going on in him his feeling par-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>took less of intuitional  conviction than of strong suspicion<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>clogged by strange dubieties. The  perplexity he evinced pro-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ceeded less from aught touching the man informed against&#x2014;as<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Claggart doubtless opined&#x2014;than from considerations how best to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>act in regard to the informer. At first indeed he was naturally for<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>summoning that substantiation  of his allegations which Clag-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>gart said was at hand. But such a proceeding would result in the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>matter at once getting abroad which in the present stage of it, he<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>thought, might undesirably affect the ship&#x0027;s company. If Claggart<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was a false witness,&#x2014;that closed the affair. And therefore before<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>trying the accusation, he would first practically test the accuser;<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and he thought this could be done in a quiet  undemonstrative<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>way.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>The measure he determined upon involved a shifting of the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>scene a transfer to a place less exposed to observation  than the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>broad quarter-deck. For although the few gun-room officers there<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>at the time had, in due observance of naval etiquette, withdrawn<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to leeward the moment Captain Vere had begun his promenade<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>on the deck&#x0027;s  weather-side; and though during the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>colloquy with Claggart they of course ventured not to diminish the dis-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tance; and though throughout the interview Captain Vere&#x0027;s voice<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was far from high, and Claggart&#x0027;s silvery and low;  and the wind<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>in the cordage and the wash of the sea helped the more to put<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n97" n="223"/></div>
<div class='line'>them beyond ear-shot; nevertheless, the interview&#x0027;s continuance<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>already had attracted observation from some topmen aloft and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>other sailors  in the waist or further forward.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Having determined upon his measures,  Captain Vere forth-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>with took action. Abruptly  turning to Claggart he asked &#x201C;Mas-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ter-at-arms, is it now Budd&#x0027;s watch aloft?&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;No, your honor.&#x201D; Whereupon, &#x201C;Mr. Wilkes!&#x201D; summoning the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>nearest midshipman, &#x201C;tell Albert to come to me.&#x201D; Albert was the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Captain&#x0027;s  hammock-boy, a sort of sea-valet in whose discretion<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and fidelity his master had much confidence. The lad appeared.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>&#x201C;You know Budd the foretopman?&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;I do, Sir.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Go find him. It is his watch off. Manage to tell him out of ear-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>shot that he is wanted aft. Contrive it that he speaks to nobody.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Keep him in talk yourself. And not till you get well aft here, not<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>till then let him know that the place where he is wanted is my<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cabin. You understand.  Go.&#x2014;Master-at-arms, show yourself on<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the decks below, and when you think it time for Albert to be com-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ing with his man, stand by quietly to follow the sailor in.&#x201D; </p></div>
<div class='line'></div1></div>

<div class='line'><div1 xml:id="t1-body-d21" type="chapter"></div>
<div class='line'><head>20 </head></div>
<div class='line'><p>Now  when the foretopman found himself closeted there,  as it<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>were, in the cabin  with the Captain and Claggart, he was sur-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>prised enough. But it was a surprise unaccompanied by apprehen-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sion or distrust. To an immature nature essentially honest and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>humane, forewarning intimations of subtler danger from one&#x0027;s kind<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>come tardily if  at all. The only thing that took shape in the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>young sailor&#x0027;s mind was this: Yes, the Captain, I have always<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>thought, looks kindly upon me. Wonder if he&#x0027;s going to make me<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>his coxswain. I should like that. And maybe now he is going to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ask the master-at-arms about me.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Shut the door there, sentry,&#x201D; said the commander;  &#x201C;standq<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>without and let nobody come in.&#x2014;Now, master-at-arms, tell this<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>man to his face what you told of him to  me;&#x201D; and stood prepared<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to scrutinize the mutually  confronting visages.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>With the measured step and calm collected air  of an asylum<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>physician approaching in the public hall some patient beginning<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to show indications of a coming paroxysm, Claggart deliberately<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n99" n="225"/></div>
<div class='line'>advanced within short range of Billy, and mesmerically looking<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>him in the eye, briefly recapitulated the accusation. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Not at first did Billy  take it in. When he did the rose-tan of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>his cheek looked struck as by white leprosy. He stood like one<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>impaled and gagged.  Meanwhile the accuser&#x0027;s  eyes removing<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>not as yet from the blue dilated ones, underwent a phenomenal<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>change, their wonted rich violet  color blurring into a muddy<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>purple. Those lights of human  intelligence losing human expres-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sion, gelidly protruding like the alien eyes of certain uncata-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>logued  creatures of the deep. The first mesmeric glance was<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>one of surprised fascination; the last was as the hungry lurch<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of the torpedo-fish. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Speak, man!&#x201D; said Captain Vere to the transfixed one struck by<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>his aspect even  more than by Claggart&#x0027;s, &#x201C;Speak! defend your-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>self.&#x201D; Which appeal caused but a strange  dumb gesturing and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>gurgling in Billy; amazement at such an accusation so suddenly<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sprung on inexperienced nonage;  this, and it may be  horror at<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n100" n="226"/></div>
<div class='line'>the accuser,  serving to bring but his lurking defect and in this<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>instance for the time intensifying it into a convulsed  tongue-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tie; while the intent head and entire form straining forward in an<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>agony of ineffectual eagerness to obey the injunction to speak and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>defend himself, gave an expression to the face like that of a con-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>demned vestal priestess  in the moment of being  buried alive,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and in the first struggle against suffocation.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Though at the time Captain Vere was quite ignorant of Billy&#x0027;s<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>liability to vocal impediment, he now immediately divined it,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>since vividly Billy&#x0027;s aspect  recalled to him that of a bright young<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>schoolmate of his whom he had seen struck by much  the same<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>startling impotence in the act of eagerly rising in the class to be<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>foremost in response to a testing question put to it by the master.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Going close up to the young sailor, and laying a soothing hand on<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>his shoulder, he  said&#x003C;:&#x003E; &#x201C;There is no hurry, my boy. Take your<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>time, take your time.&#x201D; Contrary to the effect intended, these words<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>so fatherly in tone, doubtless touching Billy&#x0027;s heart to the quick,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>prompted yet more violent efforts at utterance&#x2014;efforts soon end-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ing for the time in confirming the paralysis, and bringing to the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>face an expression which was as a crucifixion to behold. The next<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>instant, quick as the flame from a discharged cannon at night, <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>his right arm shot out, and Claggart dropped to the deck. Whether<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>intentionally or but owing to the young athlete&#x0027;s superior height,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the blow had taken effect full upon the forehead, so shapely and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>intellectual-looking a feature in the master-at-arms; so that the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>body fell over lengthwise,  like a heavy plank tilted from erect-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ness. A gasp or two and he lay motionless.</p></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n101" n="227"/></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Fated boy,&#x201D; breathed Captain Vere in tone so low as to be al-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>most a whisper, &#x201C;what have you done! But here, help me.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>The twain raised the felled one from the loins up into a sitting<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>position. The spare  form flexibly acquiesced, but inertly. It was<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>like handling a dead snake. They lowered it back. Regaining<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>erectness Captain Vere with one hand covering his face stood to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>all appearance  as impassive as the object at his feet. Was he ab-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sorbed in taking in all the bearings of the event and what was best<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>not only now at once to be done, but also in the sequel? Slowly<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>he uncovered his face; and the effect was as if the moon emerging<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>from eclipse should reappear with quite another aspect than that<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>which had gone into hiding. The father in him, manifested to-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>wards Billy thus far in the scene, was replaced by the military <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>disciplinarian. In his  official tone he bade the foretopman retire<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to a state-room aft (pointing it out) and there remain till thence<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>summoned. This order Billy in silence mechanically obeyed. <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Then, going to the cabin door where it opened on the quarter-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>deck, Captain Vere said to the sentry without, &#x201C;Tell somebody to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>send Albert here.&#x201D; When the lad appeared his master so contrived<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>it that he should not catch sight of the prone one.  &#x201C;Albert,&#x201D; he<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>said to him, &#x201C;tell the Surgeon I wish to see him. You need not<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>come back till called.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>When the Surgeon entered&#x2014;a self-poised character  of that<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>grave sense and experience that hardly anything could take him<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>aback, &#x2014;Captain Vere advanced to meet him, thus unconsciously<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>interrupting his view of Claggart and interrupting the other&#x0027;s<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>wonted  ceremonious salutation, said, &#x201C;Nay, tell me how it is<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n102" n="228"/></div>
<div class='line'>with yonder man,&#x201D; directing his attention  to the prostrate one.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>The Surgeon looked, and for all his self-command, somewhat<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>started at the abrupt revelation.  On Claggart&#x0027;s always pallid <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>complexion, thick black blood was now oozing from mouth and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ear. To the gazer&#x0027;s professional eye it was unmistakably no living<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>man  that he saw.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Is it so then?&#x003C;&#x201D;&#x003E; said Captain Vere intently watching him.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>&#x201C;I thought it. But verify it.&#x201D; Whereupon the customary tests con-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>firmed the Surgeon&#x0027;s first glance,  who now looking up in un-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>feigned concern, cast a look of intense inquisitiveness upon his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>superior.  But Captain Vere, with one hand to his brow was<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>standing motionless. Suddenly, catching the Surgeon&#x0027;s arm con-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>vulsively, he exclaimed pointing down to the body&#x2014;&#x201C;It is the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>divine judgment of Ananias! Look!&#x201D; </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Disturbed by the excited manner he had never before observed<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>in the <hi rend="italic">Indomitable&#x0027;s</hi> Captain,  and as yet wholly ignorant of the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n103" n="229"/></div>
<div class='line'>affair, the prudent  Surgeon nevertheless held his peace, only<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>again looking  an earnest interrogation as to what it was that had<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>resulted in such a tragedy.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>But Captain Vere was now  again motionless standing ab-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sorbed in thought. But again starting, he vehemently exclaimed&#x2014;<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>&#x201C;Struck dead by an  angel of God. Yet the angel must hang!&#x003C;&#x201D;&#x003E;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>At these passionate  interjections, mere incoherences to the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>listener as yet unapprised of the antecedent events, the Surgeon<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was profoundly discomfited. But now as recollecting himself, <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Captain Vere in less harsh tone briefly related the circumstances<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>leading up to the event.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;But come; we must despatch&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;Help me to remove<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>him (meaning the body)  to yonder compartment,&#x201D; designating<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>one opposite that where the foretopman remained immured.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Anew disturbed by a request that as implying a desire for secrecy,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>seemed unaccountably strange to him, there was nothing for the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>subordinate to do but comply.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Go now&#x201D; said Captain Vere with something of his wonted man-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ner, &#x201C;Go now. I shall presently  call a drumhead court. Tell the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>lieutenants what has happened, and tell Mr. Mordant,&#x201D; meaning<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the captain of marines, &#x201C;and charge them to keep the matter to<lb/></div>

<div class='line'><p>Full of disquietude and misgivings  the  Surgeon left the cabin.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Was Captain Vere suddenly affected in his mind, or was it but a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>transient excitement  brought about by so strange and  extraor-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>dinary  happening? As to  the drumhead court, it struck the Sur-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>geon as impolitic, if nothing more. The thing to do, he thought,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was to place Billy Budd in confinement,  and in a way dictated by<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>usage, and postpone further action in so extraordinary a case to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>such time as they should again join the squadron, and then refer<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>it to the Admiral. He recalled the unwonted agitation of Captain<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Vere and his excited exclamations so at variance with his normal<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>manner. Was he unhinged? But assuming that he is, it is not so<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>susceptible to proof. What then could he  do? No more trying<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>situation is conceivable than that of an officer subordinated under<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a Captain whom he suspects to be, not mad indeed, but yet not<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>quite unaffected  in his intellect. To argue his order to him would<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>be insolence. To resist him would be mutiny. In obedience to<lb/></div>

<div class='line'>prudence and rigor. Moreover there was something crucial in the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>case. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>In the jugglery of circumstances preceding and attending the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>event on board the <hi rend="italic">Indomitable</hi>  and in the light of martial code<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>whereby it was formally to be judged, innocence and guilt per-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sonified in Claggart and Budd&#x2014;in effect changed places.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>In the legal view the apparent victim of the tragedy was he who<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>had sought to victimize a man blameless; and the indisputable<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>deed of the latter,  navally regarded, constituted the most hein-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ous of military  crimes. Yet more. The essential right and wrong<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>involved  in the matter, the clearer that might be, so much the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>worse for the responsibility of a loyal sea- commander inasmuch<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n109" n="235"/></div>
<div class='line'>as he was not authorized to determine the matter  on that primi-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tive basis. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Small wonder then that the <hi rend="italic">Indomitable&#x0027;s</hi> Captain though in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>general a man of rapid  decision, felt that circumspectness not<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>less than promptitude was necessary.  Until he could decide upon<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>his course, and in each detail; and not only so, but until the con-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cluding measure  was upon the point of being enacted, he<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>deemed it advisable, in view of all the circumstances to guard as<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>much as possible against publicity. Here he may or may not have<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>erred. Certain it is however that subsequently in the confidential<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>talk of more than one or two gun-rooms and cabins  he was not<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a little criticized by some officers, a fact imputed by his friends,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and vehemently by his cousin Jack Denton, to professional jeal-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ousy of <hi rend="italic">Starry Vere</hi>. Some imaginative ground for invidious com-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ment there was. The maintenance of  secrecy in the matter, the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>confining all knowledge of it for a time to the place where the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>homicide occurred, the quarter-deck cabin; in these particulars<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>lurked some resemblance to the  policy adopted in those  trage-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>dies of the palace which have occurred more than once in the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>capital founded by Peter the Barbarian. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>The case indeed was such that fain would the <hi rend="italic">Indomitable&#x0027;s</hi><lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Captain have deferred taking any action whatever respecting it<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>further than to keep the foretopman a close prisoner till the ship<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n110" n="236"/></div>
<div class='line'>rejoined  the squadron and then submitting the matter to the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>judgment of his Admiral. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>But a true military officer is in one particular like a true monk.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Not with more of self-abnegation will the latter keep his vows of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>monastic obedience than the former his vows of allegiance to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>martial  duty.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Feeling that unless quick action were taken on it, the deed of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the foretopman, so soon as it should be known on the gun-decks <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>would tend to awaken any slumbering embers of the Nore <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>among the crew, a sense of the urgency of the case overruled in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Captain Vere  every other consideration. But though a conscien-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tious disciplinarian he was no lover of authority for mere author-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ity&#x0027;s sake. Very far was he from embracing opportunities for mo-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>nopolizing to himself the perils of moral responsibility none at<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>least that could properly be referred to an official superior  or<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>shared with him by his official equals or even subordinates. So<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>thinking he was glad it would not be at variance with usage to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>turn the matter over to a summary court of his own officers, re-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>serving to himself as the one on whom the ultimate accountability<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>would rest, the right of maintaining a supervision of it, or formally<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>or  informally interposing at need. Accordingly a drumhead<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>court was summarily convened, he electing the individuals com-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>posing it, the First Lieutenant, the Captain of marines,  and the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Sailing Master.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>In associating an officer of marines with the sea-lieutenants in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a case having to do with a sailor the Commander perhaps deviated<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n111" n="237"/></div>
<div class='line'>from general custom. He was prompted thereto by the circum-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>stance that he took that soldier to be a  judicious person, thought-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ful, and not altogether incapable  of grappling with a difficult<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>case unprecedented in his prior experience. Yet even as to him he<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was not without some latent misgiving, for withal  he was an<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>extremely good-natured man, an enjoyer of his dinner a sound<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sleeper,  and inclined to obesity. &#x003C;A&#x003E;  man who though he<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>would always maintain his manhood in battle  might not prove<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>altogether reliable in a moral dilemma involving  aught of the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tragic.  As to the First Lieutenant and the Sailing Master  Cap-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tain Vere could not but be aware that though honest natures, of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>approved gallantry upon occasion their intelligence was mostly<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>confined to the matter of active seamanship and the fighting de-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>mands of their profession.  The court was held in the same cabin<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>where the unfortunate affair had taken place. This cabin, the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Commander&#x0027;s, embraced the entire area under the poop-deck.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Aft, and on  either side was a small state-room the one room<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>temporarily a jail and the other a dead-house  and a yet smaller<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>compartment leaving a space between expanding forward  into<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n112" n="238"/></div>
<div class='line'>a goodly oblong of length coinciding with the ship&#x0027;s beam. A sky-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>light of moderate dimension was overhead and at each end of the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>oblong space were two sashed port-hole windows easily convert-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ible back into embrasures for short carronades. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>All being quickly in readiness, Billy Budd was arraigned, Cap-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tain Vere necessarily appearing as the sole witness in the case, and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>as such temporarily sinking his rank,  though singularly main-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>taining it in a matter apparently trivial, namely, that he testified<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>from the ship&#x0027;s  weather-side with that object having caused the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>court to sit on the lee-side. Concisely he narrated all that had led<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>up to the catastrophe, omitting nothing in Claggart&#x0027;s accusation<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and deposing as to the manner in which the prisoner had received<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>it. At this testimony the three officers glanced with no little sur-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>prise at Billy Budd, the last man they would have suspected either<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of mutinous design alleged by Claggart, or of the undeniable deed<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>he himself had done. The First Lieutenant, taking judicial pri-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>macy and turning toward the prisoner, said, &#x201C;Captain Vere has<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>spoken. Is it or is it not as Captain Vere says?&#x201D; In response came<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>syllables not so much impeded in the utterance as might have<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>been anticipated. They were these: &#x201C;Captain Vere tells the truth.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>It is just as Captain Vere says, but it is not as the master-in-arms<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>said. I have eaten the King&#x0027;s bread and I  am true to the King.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;I believe you, my man,&#x201D; said the  witness his voice indicating<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a suppressed emotion not otherwise betrayed.</p></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n113" n="239"/></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;God will bless you for that, your honor!&#x201D; not without stam-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>mering said Billy, and all but broke down. But immediately was<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>recalled to self-control by another question, to which with the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>same emotional  difficulty of utterance he said &#x201C;No, there was no<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>malice between us. I never bore malice against the master-at-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>arms. I am sorry that he is dead. I did not mean to kill him. Could<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>I have used my tongue I would not have struck him. But he foully<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>lied to my face and in the presence of my Captain, and I had to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>say something, and I could only say it with a blow, God help me!&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>In the impulsive above-board  manner of the frank one the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>court saw confirmed all that was implied in words that just pre-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>viously had perplexed them coming as they did from the testifier<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to the tragedy and promptly following Billy&#x0027;s impassioned  dis-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>claimer of mutinous intent&#x2014;Captain Vere&#x0027;s words, &#x201C;I believe you,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>my man.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Next it was asked  of him whether he knew of or suspected<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>aught savoring of incipient trouble (meaning mutiny, though the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>explicit term was avoided) going on in any section of the ship&#x0027;s<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>company.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>The reply lingered. This was naturally imputed by the court to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the same vocal embarrassment which had retarded or obstructed<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>previous answers. But in main it was  otherwise here; the ques-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tion immediately recalling to Billy&#x0027;s mind the interview with the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>afterguardsman in the fore-chains. But an innate repugnance to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>playing a part at all approaching that of an informer against one&#x0027;s<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>own shipmates&#x2014;the same erring sense of uninstructed honor<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>which had stood in the way of his reporting the matter at the time<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>though as a loyal man-of-war-man it was incumbent on him and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>failure so to do if charged against him and proven, would have<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n114" n="240"/></div>
<div class='line'>subjected him  to the heaviest of penalties; this,  with the blind<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>feeling now his, that nothing really was being hatched, prevail-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ing with him. When the answer came it was a negative.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201D;One question more,&#x201D; said the officer of marines now first speak-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ing and with a troubled earnestness, &#x201C;You tell us that what the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>master-at-arms said against you was a lie. Now why should he<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>have so lied, so maliciously  lied, since you declare there was no<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>malice between you?&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>At that question unintentionally  touching on a spiritual<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sphere wholly obscure to Billy&#x0027;s thoughts, he was nonplussed,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>evincing a confusion indeed that some observers, such as can<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>readily be imagined, would have construed into involuntary evi-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>dence of hidden  guilt. Nevertheless he strove some way to an-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>swer, but all at once relinquished the vain endeavor, at the same<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>time turning an appealing glance towards Captain Vere as deem-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ing him his best helper and friend. Captain Vere  who had been<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>seated for a time, rose to his feet, addressing the interrogator. <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>&#x201C;The question you put to him  comes naturally enough. But can<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>he rightly answer it? Or anybody else? Unless indeed it be he who<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>lies within there&#x201D; designating the compartment where lay the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>corpse. &#x201C;But the prone one there  will not rise to our summons.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>In effect though, as it seems to me, the point you make is hardly <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>material. Quite aside from any conceivable motive actuating the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>master-at-arms, and irrespective of the provocation of the blow, a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n115" n="241"/></div>
<div class='line'>martial court must needs in the present case confine its attention<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to the blow&#x0027;s consequence, which consequence is to be deemed<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>not otherwise than as justly the striker&#x0027;s  deed.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>This utterance the full significance of which it was not at all<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>likely that Billy took in, nevertheless caused him to turn a wistful<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>interrogative look towards the speaker, a look in its dumb expres-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>siveness not unlike that which a dog of generous breed might<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>turn  upon his master seeking in his face some elucidation of a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>previous gesture ambiguous to the canine  intelligence. Nor was<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the same utterance without marked effect upon the three officers,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>more especially the soldier. Couched in it seemed to them a mean-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ing unanticipated, involving a prejudgment  on the speaker&#x0027;s<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>part. It served to augment a mental disturbance previously evident<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>enough.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>The soldier once more spoke; in a tone of suggestive dubiety<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>addressing at once his associates and Captain Vere: &#x201C;Nobody is<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>present&#x2014;none of the ship&#x0027;s company, I mean, who might shed<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>lateral light, if any is to be had, upon what remains mysterious in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>this matter.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;That is thoughtfully put&#x201D; said Captain Vere; &#x201C;I see your drift.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Ay, there is a mystery; but to use a Scriptural phrase, it is &#x2018;a mys-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tery of iniquity,&#x2019; a matter for psychologic theologians to discuss.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>But what has a military court to do with it? Not to add that for<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>us any possible investigation of it is cut off by the lasting tongue-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tie of&#x2014;him&#x2014;in yonder,&#x201D; again designating the mortuary  state-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>room. &#x201C;The prisoner&#x0027;s deed,&#x2014;with that alone we have to do.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>To this, and particularly the closing reiteration, the marine sol-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>dier knowing not how aptly to reply, sadly abstained from saying<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n116" n="242"/></div>
<div class='line'>aught.  The First Lieutenant who at the outset had not unnatu-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>rally assumed primacy in the court, now overrulingly instructed<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>by a glance from Captain Vere, a glance more effective  than<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>words, resumed that primacy. Turning to the prisoner, &#x201C;Budd,&#x201D; he<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>said, and scarce in equable tones, &#x201C;Budd, if you have aught further<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to say for yourself, say it now.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Upon this the young  sailor turned another quick glance to-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>wards Captain Vere; then, as taking a hint from that aspect, a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>hint confirming his own instinct that silence was now best, re-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>plied to the Lieutenant,  &#x201C;I have said all, Sir.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>The marine&#x2014;the same who had been the sentinel without the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cabin-door at the time that the foretopman followed by the mas-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ter-at-arms, entered it&#x2014;he, standing by the sailor throughout their<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>judicial  proceedings, was now directed to take him back to the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>after compartment originally assigned to the prisoner and his cus-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>todian. As the twain disappeared from view,  the three officers as<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>partially liberated from some inward constraint associated with<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Billy&#x0027;s mere presence, simultaneously stirred in their seats. They<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>exchanged looks of troubled indecision, yet feeling  that decide<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>they must and without long  delay.  For Captain Vere &#x003C;was&#x003E;<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>for the time standing  unconsciously with his back towards them,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>apparently in one of his absent fits, gazing out from a sashed port-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>hole to windward upon the monotonous blank of the twilight <lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n117" n="243"/></div>
<div class='line'>sea. But the court&#x0027;s silence continuing, broken only at moments<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>by brief consultations in low earnest tones, this seemed to assure<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>him and encourage him. Turning,  he to-and-fro paced the cabin<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>athwart; in the returning ascent to windward, climbing the slant<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>deck in the ship&#x0027;s lee roll; without knowing it symbolizing thus in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>his action a  mind resolute to surmount difficulties even if against<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>primitive instincts strong as the wind and the sea.  Presently he<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>came to a stand before the three. After scanning their faces he<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>stood less as mustering his thoughts for expression, than as one <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>inly deliberating how best to put them to well-meaning men not<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>intellectually mature, men with whom it was necessary to demon-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>strate certain principles that were axioms to himself. Similar <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>impatience as to talking is perhaps one reason  that deters some<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>minds from addressing any popular assemblies. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>When speak he did, something both in the substance of what<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>he said and his manner of saying it, showed the influence of un-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>shared studies modifying and tempering the practical training of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>an active career. This, along with his phraseology now and then <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was suggestive of the grounds whereon rested that imputation of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a certain pedantry socially alleged against him by certain naval<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>men of wholly practical cast, captains who  nevertheless would<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>frankly concede that His Majesty&#x0027;s navy mustered no more efficient offi-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cers of their grade than &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Starry Vere</hi>.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n118" n="244"/></div>
<div class='line'><p>What he said was to this effect:  &#x201C;Hitherto I have been but the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>witness, little more; and I should hardly think now to take an-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>other tone, that of your coadjutor, for the time, did I not perceive<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>in you &#x2014;at the crisis too&#x2014;a troubled hesitancy, proceeding, I<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>doubt not from the clashing of military duty with moral <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>scruple&#x2014;scruple vitalized by compassion. For the compassion<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>how  can I otherwise than share it. But, mindful of para-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>mount  obligation I strive against scruples  that may tend to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>enervate decision. Not, gentlemen, that I hide from myself that<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the case  is an exceptional one. Speculatively regarded, it well<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>might be referred to a jury of casuists. But for us  here acting<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>not as casuists or moralists, it is a case practical and under martial<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>law practically  to be dealt with.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;But your scruples: do they move as in a dusk? Challenge them.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Make them advance and declare themselves.  Come now: do<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>they import something like this: If, mindless of palliating circum-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>stances we are bound to regard the death of the master-at-arms as<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the prisoner&#x0027;s deed, then does that deed constitute a capital<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>crime whereof the penalty is a mortal one. But in natural justice<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>is nothing but the prisoner&#x0027;s  overt act to be considered? How<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>can we adjudge to summary and shameful death a fellow-crea-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ture  innocent before God, and whom we feel to be so?&#x2014;Does<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n119" n="245"/></div>
<div class='line'>that state it aright? You sign sad assent.  Well, I too feel that,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the full force of that. It is Nature. But do these buttons that we<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>wear attest that our allegiance is to Nature? No, to the King.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Though the ocean, which is inviolate Nature primeval, though<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>this be the element where we move and have our being as sail-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ors, yet as the King&#x0027;s officers lies our duty in a sphere correspond-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ingly natural? So little is that true, that in receiving our commis-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sions we in the most important regards ceased to be natural<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>free-agents. When war is declared, are we the commissioned<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>fighters previously consulted? We fight at command. If our judg-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ments approve the war, that is but coincidence. So in other par-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ticulars. So now. For suppose  condemnation were to follow<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>these present  proceedings. Would it be so much we ourselves<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>that would condemn as it would be martial law operating through<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>us?  For that law and the rigor of it, we are not responsible. Our<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>vowed responsibility is in this: That however pitilessly that law<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n120" n="246"/></div>
<div class='line'>may operate,  we nevertheless adhere to it and administer it.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;But the exceptional in the matter  moves the heart within<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>you. Even so too is mine moved. But let not warm hearts betray<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>heads that should be cool. Ashore in a criminal case will an up-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>right judge allow himself off the bench to be waylaid by some<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tender kinswoman of the accused seeking to touch him with her<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tearful  plea? Well the heart sometimes the feminine in man,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>here is &#x003C;as&#x003E;  that piteous woman. And hard though it be, she<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>must here be ruled out.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>He paused, earnestly studying them for a moment; then re-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sumed.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;But something in your aspect seems to urge that it is not solely<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>that heart that moves in you, but also the conscience, the private<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>conscience. But tell me whether or not, occupying the  position<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>we do, private conscience should not yield to that imperial one<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>formulated in the code under which alone we  officially pro-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ceed?&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Here the three men moved in their seats, less convinced than <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>agitated by the course of  an argument troubling but the more<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the spontaneous conflict within. Perceiving which, the speaker<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>paused for a moment; then abruptly changing his tone, went<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>on. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;To steady us a bit, let us recur to the facts.&#x2014;In war-time at<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sea a man-of-war&#x0027;s-man strikes his superior in grade, and the blow<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>kills. Apart from its effect the blow itself is, according to the Ar-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ticles of War,  a capital crime. Furthermore&#x2014;&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n121" n="247"/></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Ay, Sir,&#x201D; emotionally broke in the officer of marines, &#x201C;in one<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sense it was. But surely Budd  purposed neither mutiny nor<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>homicide.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Surely not, my good man. And before a court less arbitrary and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>more merciful than a martial one that plea would largely extenu-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ate. At the Last Assizes it shall acquit.  But how here? We pro-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ceed under the law of the Mutiny Act. In feature no child can<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>resemble his father more than that Act resembles in spirit the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>thing from which it derives&#x2014;War. In  His Majesty&#x003C;&#x0027;s&#x003E;<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>service&#x2014;in this ship indeed&#x2014;there are Englishmen forced to fight for<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the King  against their will. Against their conscience, for aught<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>we know. Though as their fellow-creatures some of us may ap-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>preciate their position, yet as Navy Officers, what reck we of it?<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Still less recks the enemy.  Our impressed men he would fain<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cut down in the same swath with our volunteers. As regards the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>enemy&#x0027;s naval conscripts, some of whom may even share our own<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>abhorrence of the regicidal French Directory, it is the same on<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>our side. War looks but to the frontage, the appearance. And the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Mutiny Act, War&#x0027;s child, takes after the father. Budd&#x0027;s intent or<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>non-intent is nothing to the purpose.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;But while, put to it by those anxieties in you which I cannot<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>but respect, I only  repeat myself&#x2014;while thus strangely we pro-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>long proceedings that should be summary&#x2014;the enemy may be<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sighted and an engagement result. We must do; and one of two<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>things must we do&#x2014;condemn or let go.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Can we not convict and yet mitigate the penalty?&#x201D; asked the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>junior Lieutenant here speaking, and falteringly, for the first.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Lieutenant, were that clearly lawful for us under the circum-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>stances consider the consequence of such clemency. The people&#x201D;</div>

<div class='line'>(meaning the ship&#x0027;s company) &#x201C;have native  sense; most of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>them are familiar with our naval usage and tradition; and how<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>would they take it? Even could you explain to them&#x2014;which our<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>official position forbids&#x2014;they, long moulded by arbitrary disci-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>pline have not that kind of intelligent responsiveness that might <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>qualify them to comprehend and discriminate. No, to the people<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the foretopman&#x0027;s deed, however it be worded in the announce-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ment will be plain homicide committed in a flagrant act of mu-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tiny. What penalty for that should follow, they know. But it does<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>not follow. <hi rend="italic">Why?</hi> They will ruminate.  You know what sailors<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>are. Will they not revert to the recent outbreak at the Nore? Ay,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>they know  the well-founded alarm&#x2014;the panic it struck through-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>out England. Your clement sentence they would account pusil-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>lanimous. They would think that we flinch, that we are afraid of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>them&#x2014;afraid of practicing a lawful rigor singularly demanded at<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>this juncture  lest it should provoke new troubles. What shame<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to us such a conjecture on their part, and how deadly to disci-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>pline. You see then, whither prompted by duty and the law I<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>steadfastly drive. But I beseech you, my friends, do not take me<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>amiss. I feel  as you do for this unfortunate boy. But did he<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>know our hearts, I take him to be of that generous nature that he<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>would feel even for us on whom in this military necessity so heavy<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a compulsion is laid.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>With that, crossing the deck he resumed his place by the sashed<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>port-hole, tacitly leaving the three to come to a decision. On the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cabin&#x0027;s opposite side the troubled court sat silent. Loyal lieges, <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>plain and practical, though at bottom they dissented from some<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>points  Captain Vere had put to them, they were without the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n123" n="249"/></div>
<div class='line'>faculty, hardly had the inclination to gainsay one whom they felt<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to be an earnest man, one too not less their superior in mind than<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>in naval rank. But it is not improbable that even such of  his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>words as were not without influence over them, less came home<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to  them than his closing appeal to their instinct as sea-officers<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>in the forethought he threw out as to the practical consequences<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to discipline, considering the unconfirmed tone of the fleet at the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>time should a man-of-war&#x0027;s-man&#x0027;s violent killing at sea of a su-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>perior in grade  be allowed to pass for aught else than a capital<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>crime demanding  prompt infliction of the penalty. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Not unlikely they were brought to something more or less akin<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to that harassed frame of mind which in the year 1842 actuated<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the commander of the U.S. brig-of-war <hi rend="italic">Somers</hi> to resolve, under<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the so-called Articles of War&#x003C;,&#x003E; Articles modelled upon the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>English Mutiny Act, to resolve upon the execution at sea of a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>midshipman and two petty-officers as mutineers designing the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>seizure of the brig. Which resolution was carried out though in a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>time of peace and within not many days sail of home. An act vin-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>dicated by a naval court of inquiry subsequently convened ashore.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>History, and here cited without comment. True, the circum-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>stances on board the <hi rend="italic">Somers</hi> were different from those on board<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the <hi rend="italic">Indomitable</hi>. But the urgency felt, well-warranted or other-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>wise, was much the same.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Says a writer whom few know,  &#x201C;Forty years after a battle it<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>is easy for a non-combatant to reason about how it ought to have<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>been fought. It is another thing personally and under fire to di-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>rect the fighting while  involved in the obscuring smoke of it.</p></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n124" n="250"/></div>
<div class='line'><p>Much so with respect to other  emergencies involving considera-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tions both practical and moral, and when it is imperative promptly<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to act. The greater the fog the more it imperils the steamer,  and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>speed is put on though at the hazard of running somebody down.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Little ween the snug card-players in the cabin of the responsibil-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ities of the sleepless man on the bridge.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>In brief, Billy Budd was formally convicted and sentenced to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>be hung at the yard-arm in the early morning-watch, it being now<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>night. Otherwise, as is customary in such cases, the sentence<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>would forthwith have been carried out. In war-time on the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>field or in the fleet, a mortal punishment decreed by a drumhead<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>court&#x2014;on the field sometimes decreed by but a nod from the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>General&#x2014;follows without a delay on the heel of conviction with-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>out appeal.</p></div>

<div class='line'><head>23</head></div>
<div class='line'><p>It was Captain Vere himself who of his own motion communi-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cated the finding of the court to the prisoner; for that purpose<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>going to the compartment where he was in custody and bidding<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the marine there to withdraw for the time.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Beyond the communication of the sentence what took place at<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>this interview was never known. But in view of the character of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the twain briefly closeted in that stateroom, each radically sharing<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>in the rarer qualities of one nature&#x2014;so rare indeed as to be all<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>but  incredible to average  minds however much cultivated&#x2014;<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>some conjectures may be ventured.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>It would have been in consonance with the spirit of Captain<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Vere should he on this occasion have concealed nothing from the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>condemned one&#x2014;should he indeed have frankly disclosed to him<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the part he himself had played in bringing about the decision, at<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the same time revealing his actuating motives. On Billy&#x0027;s side it<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>is not improbable that  such a confession would have been re-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ceived in much the same spirit that prompted it. Not without a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sort of joy indeed he might have appreciated  the brave opinion<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of him implied in his Captain making such a confidant of him.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Nor, as to the sentence itself could he have been insensible that<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>it was imparted to him as to one not afraid to die. Even more may<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>have been. Captain Vere in &#x003C;the&#x003E; end may have developed the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n126" n="252"/></div>
<div class='line'>passion sometimes latent under an exterior stoical or indifferent. <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>He was old enough to have been Billy&#x0027;s father. The austere  devo-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tee of military duty letting himself melt back into what remains <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>primeval in our formalized humanity may in &#x003C;the&#x003E; end have<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>caught Billy to his heart even as  Abraham may have caught<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>young Isaac on the brink of resolutely offering him up in obedi-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ence to the exacting behest.  But there is no telling the sacra-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ment, seldom if in any case revealed to the gadding world wher-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ever under circumstances at all akin to those here attempted to be<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>set forth two of great Nature&#x0027;s  nobler order embrace. There is<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>privacy at the time, inviolable  to the survivor, and holy oblivion<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the sequel to each diviner magnanimity, providentially covers all<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>at last. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>The first to encounter Captain Vere in act of leaving the com-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>partment was the senior  Lieutenant. The face he beheld, for the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>moment one  expressive of the agony of the strong, was to that<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>officer,  though a man of fifty, a startling revelation. That the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>condemned one suffered less than he who mainly had effected the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>condemnation was apparently indicated by the former&#x0027;s exclama-<lb/></div>

<div class='line'><p>Of a series  of incidents within a brief term rapidly following each<lb/></div>

<div class='line'>especially if explanation or comment here and there seem requi-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>site to the better  understanding of such incidents. Between the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>entrance into the cabin of him who never left it alive, and him<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>who when he did leave it left it as one condemned to die; be-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tween this and the closeted interview just given less than an hour<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and a half had elapsed. It was an interval long enough however<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to awaken speculations among no few of the ship&#x0027;s company as to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>what it was that could be detaining in the cabin  the master-at-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>arms and the sailor; for a rumor that both of them had been seen<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to enter it and neither of them had been seen to emerge, this ru-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>mor had got abroad upon the gun-decks and in the tops; the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>people of a great warship being in one respect like villagers, tak-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ing microscopic note of every outward movement or non-move-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ment  going on. When therefore in weather not at all tempestu-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ous all hands were called in the second dog-watch, a summons<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>under such circumstances  not usual in those hours, the crew <lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n128" n="254"/></div>
<div class='line'>were not wholly unprepared for some announcement extraordi-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>nary, one having connection too with the continued  absence of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the two men from their wonted haunts.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>There was a moderate sea at the time; and the moon, newly<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>risen and near to being at its full, silvered the white spar-deck <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>wherever not blotted by the clear-cut shadows horizontally<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>thrown of fixtures and moving men. On either side the quarter-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>deck the marine guard under arms was drawn up; and Captain<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Vere standing in his place surrounded by all the ward-room offi-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cers, addressed his men. In so doing his manner showed neither<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>more nor less than that properly pertaining to his supreme posi-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tion aboard his own ship.  In clear terms and concise he told<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>them what had taken place in the  cabin; that the master-at-arms<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was dead; that he who had killed him had been already  tried by<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a summary court and condemned to death;  and that the execu-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tion would take place in the early morning watch. The word <hi rend="italic">mu-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tiny</hi> was not named in what he said. He refrained too from making<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the occasion an opportunity for any preachment as to the main-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tenance of discipline, thinking perhaps that under existing cir-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cumstances in the navy the consequence of violating discipline<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>should be made to speak  for itself.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Their Captain&#x0027;s announcement was listened to by the throng of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>standing sailors in a dumbness like that of a seated congregation<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of believers in hell listening to the clergyman&#x0027;s announcement of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>his Calvinistic text. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>At the close, however, a confused murmur went up. It began to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n129" n="255"/></div>
<div class='line'>wax.  All but instantly, then, at a sign, &#x003C;it&#x003E; was pierced and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>suppressed by shrill whistles of  the Boatswain and his mates<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>piping down one watch. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>To be prepared for burial Claggart&#x0027;s body was delivered to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>certain petty-officers of his mess. And here, not to clog the sequel<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>with lateral matters, it may be added that at a suitable hour, <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the master-at-arms was committed to the sea with every funeral<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>honor properly belonging to his naval grade.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>In this proceeding as in every public one growing out of the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tragedy strict adherence to usage was observed. Nor in any point<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>could it have been at all deviated from either with respect to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Claggart or Billy Budd  without begetting undesirable specula-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tions in the ship&#x0027;s company, sailors, and more particularly men-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of-war&#x0027;s men, being of all men the greatest sticklers for usage.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>For similar cause all communication between Captain Vere and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the condemned one ended  with the closeted interview already<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>given, the latter being now surrendered to the ordinary routine<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>preliminary to the end. This transfer under guard from the Cap-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tain&#x0027;s quarters was effected without unusual precautions&#x2014;at least<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>no visible ones. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>If possible not to let the men so much as surmise that their of-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ficers anticipate aught amiss from them is the tacit rule in a mili-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tary ship. And the more that some sort of trouble should really<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>be apprehended the more do the officers keep that apprehension<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n130" n="256"/></div>
<div class='line'>to themselves; though not the less unostentatious vigilance  may<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>be augmented.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>In the present instance the sentry placed over the prisoner had<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>strict orders to let no one have communication with him but the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Chaplain. And certain unobtrusive measures were taken abso-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>lutely to insure this point.</p></div>

<div class='line'><p>In a seventy-four of the old order the deck known as the upper<lb/></div>

<div class='line'>in loops overhead&#x2014;all these, as customary, were painted black; and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the heavy hempen breechings tarred to the same tint, wore the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>like livery of the undertakers.  In contrast with the funereal tone<lb/></div>

<div class='line'>of these surroundings the prone sailor&#x0027;s exterior  apparel, white<lb/></div>

<div class='line'>him, two battle-lanterns swing from two massive beams of the<lb/></div>

<div class='line'>(whose gains, honest or otherwise, are in every land an antici-<lb/></div>

<div class='line'>and the sun to have brought about the effacement of that.  But<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the skeleton in  the cheek-bone at the point of its angle was just<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>beginning delicately to be defined  under the warm-tinted skin.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>In fervid hearts self-contained  some brief experiences devour<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>our human tissue as secret fire in a ship&#x0027;s hold consumes cotton in<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the bale.</p></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n133" n="259"/></div>
<div class='line'><p>But now lying between the two guns, as nipped in the vice of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>fate, Billy&#x0027;s agony, mainly  proceeding from a generous young<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>heart&#x0027;s virgin experience of the diabolical incarnate and effec-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tive  in some men&#x2014;the tension of that agony was over now. <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>It survived not the something healing in the closeted interview<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>with Captain Vere. Without movement, he lay as in a trance.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>That adolescent expression previously noted as his, taking on <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>something akin to the look of a child slumbering  in the cradle<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>when the warm hearth-glow  of the still chamber at night plays<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>on the dimples that at whiles mysteriously form in the cheek,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>silently coming and going there. For now and then in the gyved<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>one&#x0027;s  trance a serene happy light born of some wandering rem-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>iniscence or dream would diffuse itself over his  face, and then<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>wane away only anew to return.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>The Chaplain coming to see him and finding him thus, and per-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ceiving no sign that he was conscious of his presence, attentively<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>regarded him  for a space, then slipping aside, withdrew for the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>time, peradventure feeling that even he the  minister of Christ <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>though receiving his stipend from Mars  had no consolation to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>proffer which could result in a peace transcending that which <lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n134" n="260"/></div>
<div class='line'>he beheld. But in the  small hours he came again. And the pris-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>oner now awake to his surroundings noticed his approach and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>civilly, all but cheerfully, welcomed him. But it was to little pur-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>pose that in the interview following the good man  sought to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>bring Billy Budd to some Godly understanding that he must die,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and at dawn. True, Billy himself freely referred to  his death as<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a thing close at hand; but it was something in the way that chil-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>dren will refer to death in general, who yet among their other<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sports will  play a funeral with hearse and mourners.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Not that like children Billy was incapable of conceiving what<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>death really is. No, but he was wholly without irrational fear of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>it, a fear more prevalent in  highly civilized communities than<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>those so-called barbarous ones which in all respects stand nearer<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to unadulterate  Nature. And, as elsewhere said, a barbarian<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Billy radically was; as much so, for all the costume, as his country-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>men the British captives, living trophies, made to march in the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Roman triumph of Germanicus.  Quite as much so as those later<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>barbarians, young men probably, and picked specimens  among<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the earlier British converts to Christianity, at least nominally<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>such  and taken to Rome (as today converts from lesser isles of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the sea  may be taken to London) of whom the Pope of that<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>time, admiring the strangeness of their personal beauty so unlike<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the Italian stamp, their clear ruddy complexions and curled flaxen<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>locks,  exclaimed, &#x201C;Angles&#x201D; (meaning <hi rend="italic">English</hi> the modern  de-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n135" n="261"/></div>
<div class='line'>rivative) &#x201C;Angles do you call them? And is it because they look so<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>like angels?&#x201D; Had it been later in time one would think that the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Pope had in mind Fra Angelico&#x0027;s seraphs some of whom,  pluck-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ing apples in  gardens of the Hesperides have the faint rosebud<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>complexion of the more  beautiful English girls.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>If in vain the good Chaplain sought to impress the young bar-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>barian with ideas of death akin to those conveyed in the skull,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>dial and cross-bones on old tombstones; equally futile to all ap-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>pearance were his efforts to bring home to him the thought of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>salvation  and a Saviour. Billy listened, but less out of awe or rev-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>erence perhaps  than from a certain natural politeness; doubt-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>less at bottom regarding all that in much the same way that most<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>mariners of his class take any discourse abstract or out of the com-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>mon tone of the work-a-day world. And this sailor way of taking<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>clerical discourse  is not wholly unlike the way in which the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>pioneer  of Christianity full of transcendent  miracles was re-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ceived long ago on tropic isles by any superior  <hi rend="italic">savage</hi> so called<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>&#x2014;a Tahitian say of Captain Cook&#x0027;s time or shortly after that time.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Out of natural courtesy he received  but  did not appropriate.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>It was like a gift placed in the palm of an outstretched  hand<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>upon which the fingers do not close.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>But the <hi rend="italic">Indomitable&#x0027;s</hi> Chaplain was a discreet  man possessing<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n136" n="262"/></div>
<div class='line'>the  good sense of a good heart. So he insisted not in his voca-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tion here. At the instance of Captain Vere, a lieutenant had ap-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>prised him of pretty much of everything as to Billy; and since he<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>felt that innocence was even a better thing than religion  where-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>with to go to Judgment, he reluctantly withdrew; but in his emo-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tion not without first  performing an act strange enough in an<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Englishman, and under the circumstances yet more so in any reg-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ular priest. Stooping over, he kissed on the fair cheek his fellow<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>man, a felon in martial law, one who though in the confines of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>death he felt he could never convert to a dogma; nor for all that<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>did he fear for his future. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Marvel not that having been acquainted with the young sailor&#x0027;s<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>essential innocence (an irruption of heretic thought hard to sup-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>press)  the worthy man lifted not a finger to avert the doom of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>such a martyr to martial discipline. So to do would not only have<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>been as idle as invoking the desert, but would also have been an<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>audacious transgression of the bounds of his function, one as ex-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>actly prescribed to him by military law as that of the boatswain<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>&#x003C;or&#x003E;  any other naval officer. Bluntly put, a chaplain is  the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>minister of the Prince of Peace serving in the host of the God of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>War&#x2014;Mars. As such, he is as incongruous as that musket of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Bl&#x00FC;cher etc.  at Christmas.  Why then is he<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>there? Because he indirectly subserves the purpose attested by the cannon; because<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>too he lends the sanction of the religion of the meek to that<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>which practically is the abrogation of everything but brute  force.</p></div>

<div class='line'><p>The night so luminous on the  spar-deck but otherwise on the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cavernous ones below, levels so like the tiered galleries in a coal-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>mine&#x2014;the luminous night passed away. But, like the prophet in the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>chariot disappearing in heaven and dropping his mantle to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Elisha, the withdrawing night transferred its pale robe to the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>breaking day.  A meek shy light appeared in the East, where<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>stretched  a diaphanous fleece of white  furrowed vapor. That<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>light slowly waxed. Suddenly <hi rend="italic">eight bells</hi>  was struck aft, re-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sponded to by one louder metallic  stroke from forward. It was <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>four o&#x0027;clock in the morning. Instantly the silver  whistles were<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>heard summoning all hands to witness punishment. Up through<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the great hatchways rimmed with racks of heavy shot, the watch<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>below came pouring overspreading with the watch already on<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>deck  the space between the mainmast and foremast including<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>that occupied by the capacious <hi rend="italic">launch</hi> and the black booms tiered<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>on either side of it, boat and booms making a summit of observa-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tion for the powder-  boys and younger tars. A different group<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>comprising one watch of topmen leaned over the side of the rail<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of that sea-balcony, no small one in a seventy-four, looking down<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n140" n="264"/></div>
<div class='line'>on the crowd below. Man or boy none spake  but in whisper,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and few spake  at all. Captain Vere&#x2014;as before, the central figure<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>among the assembled commissioned officers&#x2014;stood nigh the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>break of the poop-deck facing forward.  Just below him on the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>quarter-deck the marines in full equipment were drawn up much<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>as at the scene of the promulgated sentence.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>At sea in the old time, the execution by halter of a military<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sailor was generally from the fore-yard. In the present instance for<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>special  reasons  the main-yard was assigned. Under an arm<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of that weather or lee &#x003C;?&#x003E; yard the prisoner was presently<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>brought up, the Chaplain attending him. It was noted at the time<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and remarked upon afterwards, that in this final scene the good<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>man evinced little or nothing of the perfunctory. Brief speech in-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>deed he had with the condemned one, but the genuine Gospel<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was less  on his tongue than in his aspect and  manner towards<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>him. The final preparations personal to the latter being speedily<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>brought to an end by two boatswain&#x0027;s-mates, the consummation <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>impended. Billy stood facing aft.  At the penultimate moment,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>his  words, his only ones, words wholly unobstructed in the utter-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ance were these&#x2014;&#x201C;God bless Captain Vere!&#x201D; Syllables so unan-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ticipated  coming from one with the ignominious hemp  about<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n141" n="265"/></div>
<div class='line'>his neck&#x2014;a conventional felon&#x0027;s benediction directed aft  to-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>wards the quarters of honor; syllables too  delivered in the clear<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>melody of a singing-bird on the point of launching  from the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>twig, had a phenomenal effect, not unenhanced by the rare  per-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sonal beauty of the young sailor  spiritualized now through late<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>experiences so poignantly profound.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Without volition as it were, as if indeed the ship&#x0027;s populace<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>were the vehicles of some vocal current electric, with one voice<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>from alow and aloft, came a resonant sympathetic  echo&#x2014;&#x201C;God<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>bless Captain Vere!&#x201D; And yet at that instant  Billy alone must<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>have been in their hearts, even as he was in their eyes.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>At the pronounced words and the spontaneous echo that volu-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>minously rebounded them, Captain Vere, either through stoic<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>self-control or a sort of momentary  paralysis induced by emo-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tional shock, stood erectly rigid as a musket in the ship-armorer&#x0027;s <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>rack.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>The  hull deliberately recovering from the periodic roll to lee-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ward  was just regaining an even keel, when the last signal the<lb/></div>

<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n142" n="266"/></div>
<div class='line'>chanced that the vapory fleece hanging low in the East, was shot<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>through with a soft glory as of the fleece  of the Lamb of God<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>seen in mystical vision and simultaneously  therewith, watched<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>by the wedged mass of upturned faces, Billy ascended; and as-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cending, took the full rose of the  dawn.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>In the pinioned figure arrived at the yard-end, to the wonder of<lb/></div>

<div class='line'><p>When some days afterwards  in reference to the singularity just<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>mentioned,  the Purser a rather ruddy rotund person  more ac-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>curate as an accountant than profound as a philosopher  said at<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>mess to the Surgeon, &#x201C;What testimony to the force lodged in will-<lb/></div>

<div class='line'>creet causticity went along with a manner less genial than  polite,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>replied,  &#x201C;Your pardon, Mr. Purser. In a hanging scientifically con-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ducted&#x2014;and under special orders I myself directed how Budd&#x0027;s<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was to be effected&#x2014;any movement  following the completed sus-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>pension and originating in the body suspended, such movement <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>indicates mechanical spasm in the muscular system. Hence the absence of that<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>is no more attributable to  will-power as you call<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>it than to  horsepower&#x2014;begging your pardon.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n144" n="268"/></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;But this muscular spasm you speak of, is not that in a degree<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>more or less invariable in these cases?&#x003C;&#x201D;&#x003E;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Assuredly so, Mr. Purser.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;How then, my good Sir, do you account for its absence in this<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>instance?&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Mr. Purser, it is clear that your sense of the singularity in this<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>matter equals not mine. You account for it by what you call will-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>power a term not yet included in the lexicon of science. For me I<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>do not, with my present knowledge pretend  to account for it<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>at  all. Even should one assume the hypothesis that at the first<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>touch of the halyards the action of Budd&#x0027;s heart, intensified by<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>extraordinary emotion at its climax, abruptly stopped&#x2014;much like<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a watch when in carelessly winding it up you strain at the finish,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>thus snapping the chain&#x2014;even under that hypothesis how ac-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>count for the phenomenon that followed?&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;You admit then that the absence of spasmodic movement was<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>phenomenal.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;It was phenomenal, Mr. Purser, in the sense that it was an ap-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>pearance the cause of which is not immediately to be assigned.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;But tell me, my dear Sir,&#x201D; pertinaciously continued the other,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>&#x201C;was the man&#x0027;s death effected by the halter, or was it a species of<lb/></div>

<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Euthanasia</hi>, Mr. Purser, is something like your <hi rend="italic">will-power;</hi> I<lb/></div>

<div class='line'>again. It is at once  imaginative and  metaphysical,&#x2014;in short,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Greek. But&#x201D; abruptly  changing his tone, &#x201C;there is a case in the<lb/></div>

<div class='line'><p>The silence at the moment of execution and for a moment or<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>two continuing thereafter, a silence but emphasized by the reg-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ular wash of the sea against the hull or the flutter of a sail caused<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>by the helmsman&#x0027;s eyes being tempted astray, this emphasized<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>silence was gradually  disturbed by a sound not easily to be here<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>verbally rendered. Whoever has heard  the freshet-wave of a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>torrent suddenly swelled by pouring showers  in the tropical<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>mountains, showers  not shared by the plain; whoever has heard<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the first muffled murmur of its sloping advance through precipi-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tous woods,  may form some conception of the sound now heard.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>The seeming remoteness of its source was because of its murmur-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ous indistinctness since  it came from close by, even from the men<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>massed on the ship&#x0027;s open deck. Being inarticulate, it was dubious<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>in significance further  that it seemed to indicate some capricious<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>revulsion of thought or feeling such as mobs ashore are liable  to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n146" n="270"/></div>
<div class='line'>in the present instance possibly implying a sullen revocation on<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the men&#x0027;s part of their involuntary echoing of Billy&#x0027;s benediction.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>But ere the murmur  had time to wax into  clamor it was met<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>by a strategic command, the more telling that it came with abrupt<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>unexpectedness.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;Pipe down the starboard watch Boatswain, and see that they <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>go.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Shrill as the shriek of the sea-hawk the whistles of the Boat-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>swain  and his Mates pierced that ominous low sound, dissipat-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ing it; and yielding to the mechanism of discipline the throng was<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>thinned by one half. For the remainder most of them were set to <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>temporary employments connected with trimming the yards and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>so forth, business  readily to be got up to serve occasion  by any<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>officer-of-the-deck.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Now  each proceeding that follows a mortal sentence pro-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>nounced at sea by a drumhead court is characterized by a promp-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>titude not perceptibly merging into hurry, though bordering<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>that. The hammock, the one which had been  Billy&#x0027;s bed when<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>alive, having already been ballasted  with shot and otherwise<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>prepared to serve for his canvas  coffin, the last offices of the sea-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>undertakers, the Sailmaker&#x0027;s Mates, were now speedily completed.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>When everything was in readiness a second call for all hands<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>made necessary by the strategic  movement before mentioned <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was sounded and now to witness burial.</p></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n147" n="271"/></div>
<div class='line'><p>The details of this closing formality it needs not to give. But<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>when the tilted plank let slide its freight into the sea, a second<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>strange  human murmur was heard, blended now with another<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>inarticulate sound proceeding from certain larger  sea-fowl<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>whose attention having been attracted by the peculiar  commo-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tion in the water resulting from the heavy sloped dive of the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>shotted hammock into the sea  flew screaming to the spot. So<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>near the hull did they come, that the stridor or bony creak of their<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>gaunt double-jointed pinions was audible. As the ship under light<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>airs passed on, leaving the burial spot astern, they still kept cir-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cling it low down with the moving shadow of their outstretched<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>wings and the cracked requiem of their cries.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Upon sailors as superstitious as those of the age preceding ours,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>men-of-war&#x0027;s men too  who had just beheld the prodigy of repose<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>in the form suspended in air and now foundering in the deeps; <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to such mariners the action of the sea-fowl though dictated by a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>mere animal greed  for prey, was big with no prosaic signifi-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cance. An uncertain  movement began among them, in which<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>some encroachment was made. It was tolerated but for a moment.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>For suddenly the drum beat to quarters, which familiar sound<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>happening at least  twice a day, had upon the present occasion<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>some signal  peremptoriness in it. True martial discipline long<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>continued superinduces in an average man a sort of impulse of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n148" n="272"/></div>
<div class='line'>docility whose operation at the official sound of command much<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>resembles in its promptitude the effect of an instinct. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>The drum-beat dissolved the multitude, distributing most of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>them along the batteries of the two covered gun-decks. There, as<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>wont, the gun&#x0027;s crews stood by their respective cannon erect and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>silent. In due course the First officer, sword under arm and stand-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ing in his place on the quarter-deck formally  received the suc-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cessive reports of the sworded Lieutenants commanding the sec-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tions of batteries below; the last of which reports being made the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>summed report he delivered with the customary salute to the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Commander. All this occupied time, which, in the present case,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was the object of beating to quarters at an hour prior to the cus-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tomary one. </div>
<div class='line'> That such variance from usage was authorized by<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>an officer like Captain Vere, a martinet as some deemed him, was<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>evidence of the necessity for unusual action  implied in what he<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>deemed to be temporarily the mood of his men. &#x201C;With mankind&#x201D;<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>he would say &#x201C;forms, measured forms  are everything; and that<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>is the  import couched in the story of Orpheus with his lyre spell-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>binding the wild denizens of the woods.&#x201D; And this he once ap-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>plied to the disruption of forms going on across the Channel and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the consequences thereof. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>At this unwonted muster  at quarters, all proceeded as at the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>regular hour. The band on the quarter-deck played a sacred air.<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>After which the Chaplain went through with the customary morn-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ing service. That done, the drum beat the retreat, and toned by<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n149" n="273"/></div>
<div class='line'>music and  religious rites subserving the discipline and pur-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>pose  of war, the men in their wonted orderly manner dispersed<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to the places allotted them when not at the guns.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>And now it was full day. The fleece of low-hanging vapor had<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>vanished, licked up by the sun that late had so glorified it. And the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>circumambient air in the clearness of its serenity was like  smooth<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>white marble in the polished block not yet removed from the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>marble-dealer&#x0027;s yard.</p></div>

<div class='line'><p>The symmetry of form attainable in pure fiction cannot so read-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ily be achieved in a narration essentially  having less to do with<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>fable than with fact. Truth uncompromisingly told will always<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>have its ragged edges; hence the conclusion of such a narration<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>is apt to be less finished than an architectural finial.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>How it fared with the Handsome Sailor during the year of the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>great mutiny has been faithfully given. But though properly the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>story ends with his life something in way of sequel will not<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>be amiss. Three brief chapters will suffice.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>In the general re-christening under the Directory of the craft<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>originally forming the navy of the French Monarchy, the <hi rend="italic">St. Louis</hi><lb/></div>
<div class='line'>line-of-battle ship was named the <hi rend="italic">Ath&#x00E9;iste</hi>.  Such a name, like<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>some other substituted ones in the Revolutionary fleet while pro-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>claiming the infidel audacity of the ruling power was yet, though<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>not so intended to be, the aptest name, if one consider it, ever<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>given to a warship; far more so indeed than the <hi rend="italic">Devastation</hi>, the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><hi rend="italic">Erebus</hi> (the <hi rend="italic">Hell</hi>) and similar names bestowed upon fighting-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ships.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>On the return passage to the English fleet from the detached<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>cruise during which occurred the events already recorded, the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><hi rend="italic">Indomitable</hi>  fell in with the <hi rend="italic">Ath&#x00E9;iste</hi>.  An engagement ensued;<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>during which Captain Vere in the act of putting his ship along-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>side the enemy with a view of throwing his boarders across the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n151" n="275"/></div>
<div class='line'>bulwarks,  was hit by a musket-ball from a port-hole of the en-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>emy&#x0027;s main cabin. More than disabled he dropped to the deck<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and was carried below to the same cock-pit where some of his<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>men already lay. The senior Lieutenant took command. Under<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>him the enemy was finally captured and though much crippled<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was by rare good fortune successfully taken into Gibraltar, an<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>English port not very  distant from the scene of the fight. There,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>Captain Vere with the rest of the wounded was put ashore. He<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>lingered for some days, but the end came. Unhappily he was cut<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>off too early for the Nile and Trafalgar. The spirit that spite its<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>philosophic austerity may yet have  indulged in the most secret<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of all passions, ambition,  never attained to the fullness of fame.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>Not long before death while lying under the influence of that<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>magical drug which soothing the physical frame mysteriously<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>operates on the subtler element in man, he was heard to murmur<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>words inexplicable to his attendant&#x2014;&#x201C;Billy Budd, Billy Budd.&#x201D;<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>That these were not the accents of remorse, would seem  clear<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>from what the attendant said to the <hi rend="italic">Indomitable&#x0027;s</hi> senior officer<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of marines who as the most reluctant to condemn of the members<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of the drumhead court, too well knew though here he kept the<lb/></div>

<div class='line'>peared in a naval chronicle of the time, an authorized weekly pub-<lb/></div>

<div class='line'>part  written in good faith, though the medium, partly rumor,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>through which the facts must have reached the writer, served to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>deflect and in part falsify  them. The account was as follows:&#x2014;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x201C;On the tenth of the last month a deplorable occurrence took<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>place on board <hi rend="italic">H.M.S. Indomitable</hi>. John Claggart, the ship&#x0027;s<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>master-at-arms, discovering that some sort of plot was incipient <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>among an inferior section of the ship&#x0027;s company, and that the ring-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>leader  was one William Budd;  he, Claggart  in the act of ar-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>raigning the man before the Captain was vindictively  stabbed<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>to the heart by the suddenly drawn sheath-knife of Budd.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x003C;&#x201C;&#x003E;The deed and the implement employed, sufficiently sug-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>gest that though mustered into the service under an English name,<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the assassin was no Englishman, but one of those aliens adopting<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>English cognomens whom the present extraordinary  necessities<lb/></div>
<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n153" n="277"/></div>
<div class='line'>of the Service have caused to be admitted into it in considerable<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>numbers. </p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x003C;&#x201C;&#x003E;The enormity of the crime and the extreme depravity of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>the criminal, appear the greater in view of the character of the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>victim, a middle-aged man respectable and discreet, belonging to<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>that minor official grade, the petty-officers, upon whom, as none<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>know better than the commissioned gentlemen, the efficiency of<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>His Majesty&#x0027;s navy so largely depends. His function was a respon-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sible one; at once onerous and thankless and his fidelity in it the<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>greater because of his strong patriotic impulse.  In this instance<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>as in so many other instances in these days, the character of this<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>unfortunate  man signally refutes, if refutation were needed, that<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>peevish saying attributed to the late Dr. Johnson, that patriotism<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>is the last refuge of a scoundrel.</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>&#x003C;&#x201C;&#x003E;The criminal paid the penalty of his crime. The prompti-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>tude of the punishment  has proved salutary. Nothing amiss is<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>now apprehended aboard the <hi rend="italic">H.M.S. Indomitable</hi>.&#x201D;</p></div>
<div class='line'><p>The above item appearing in a publication now long ago super-<lb/></div>

<div class='line'><p>Everything is for a term remarkable in navies. Any tangible<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>object associated with some striking incident of the service  is<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>converted into a monument. The spar from which the foretopman<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>was suspended, was for some few years kept trace of  by the blue-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>jackets. Then knowledge followed  it from ship to dock-yard and<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>again from dock-yard to ship, still pursuing it even when at last <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>reduced to a mere dock-yard boom. To them a chip of it was as<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>a piece of the Cross. Ignorant though they were of the secret facts<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of the tragedy, and not thinking but that the penalty was some-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>how unavoidably  inflicted from the naval point of view, for all<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>that  they instinctively felt  that Billy was a sort of man as incapa-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>ble of mutiny as  of willful murder. They recalled the fresh young<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>image of the Handsome Sailor, that face never deformed by a<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>sneer or subtler vile freak of the heart  within! This impression<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>of him was doubtless deepened by the fact that he was gone, <lb/></div>
<div class='line'>and in a measure  mysteriously gone. On the gun-decks of the<lb/></div>

<div class='line'><pb xml:id="n155" n="279"/></div>
<div class='line'>simplicity eventually found rude utterance from another foreto-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>pman, one of his own watch, gifted as some sailors are with an art-<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>less poetic temperament. The tarry hands made some lines which<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>after circulating among the shipboard crew for a while finally got<lb/></div>
<div class='line'>rudely printed at Portsmouth as a ballad. The title given to it was<lb/></div>
